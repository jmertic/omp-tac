00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.890
John Mertic: Hey how's it going

2
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.280
pfandel: Good, how are you. Wow.

3
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.230
JP Linardon: Hi, Bob.

4
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.980
John Mertic: Hey Mike, how you doing,

5
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.270
Mike MacIsaac: Pretty good. How are you, I'm well, thanks.

6
00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:15.360
John Mertic: Give it a few more minutes for people to pop in my Dino is filtering you today.

7
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.430
Mike MacIsaac: I do not think so he's, he hasn't been online today. Okay.

8
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.720
John Mertic: It two minutes after the hour here just see if we get anyone else.

9
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:28.770
John Mertic: How you doing,

10
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.980
Ingo Adlung: Doing fine only one more day to go and so I must be doing good.

11
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.690
John Mertic: There you go. There you go.

12
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:55.530
John Mertic: Let's few minutes after the hour. I don't know if we'll get others to join. Here we leave to voting members today, but I think today's mostly just updates. Anyways, so we can move forward. I have the agenda is up on

13
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:02.280
Here.

14
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.570
Everyone can follow it home.

15
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.470
There's the link I just dropped it in the chat.

16
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.400
John Mertic: I'm pretty straightforward meeting today just kind of go through where we're at with all the projects.

17
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:36.960
John Mertic: We've had an agenda item on here, which we've not really proceeded on and I guess I'd be kind of getting everyone's taking whether we should still keep it on here.

18
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:48.990
John Mertic: Along renewal of incubation process projects and the criteria for considering marital status, and then I think we still had this one in here for a while and

19
00:10:49.920 --> 00:11:03.870
John Mertic: We've not got any sort of more traction on it. So I'm wondering if maybe after the first year we drop it and we just wait to see if someone adds it back. And that's the project proposal for communities on Linux one

20
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.660
John Mertic: So that's pretty much what we had for today. Anything else anyone who would like to add to the call.

21
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:12.990
Hey, come on. JOHN

22
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.630
JP Linardon: We're going to talk about internships. Right.

23
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.170
John Mertic: Yes, that is in there. Yes, we have. That's a

24
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:22.950
John Mertic: Mentorship. Yep.

25
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:24.900
JP Linardon: Okay.

26
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.400
John Mertic: We can't forget about that one.

27
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.620
John Mertic: Yeah, we'll do that in the project updates.

28
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:31.800
John Mertic: Sound good

29
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.080
John Mertic: Yes, sir.

30
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.580
JP Linardon: Cool, alright.

31
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:47.010
John Mertic: So let's go into incubating projects. I think I see some folks from the Venus Project. Do we have any updates from that project to share

32
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:50.580
pfandel: Yeah. Hi, this is Peter

33
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.490
pfandel: I do because this is tied in with a larger

34
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.060
pfandel: Business model proposal here rocket

35
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:11.280
pfandel: I'm going to give you the update on that and I did speak to the Eunice early in the week and he is in meetings with Barry Baker.

36
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.770
pfandel: And pair of IBM either today or tomorrow.

37
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.080
pfandel: To discuss this.

38
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:35.460
pfandel: I have I'm in late stages of preparing the concept proposal to present to rockets executive team. And those are the kind of the prerequisites for us moving forward and

39
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.500
pfandel: The next steps for amateurs, which is pushing all of our sources up in the forget have

40
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.070
John Mertic: Any other

41
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.180
John Mertic: I mean, I don't know if you have

42
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:51.450
pfandel: Anything.

43
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:51.960
John Mertic: To add on.

44
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.280
John Mertic: Top of that Joe

45
00:12:53.940 --> 00:13:07.140
Joe Bostian: Yeah, so, um, there's some some work that we've got on the IBM side to to push out some examples and some sample kinds of things. That's kind of distinct from the work that Peter side of the House is doing.

46
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.120
Joe Bostian: But we want to get a lot of, you know, sort of how to and informational stuff out there.

47
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.850
Joe Bostian: Over the next few weeks before the end of the year. So there'll be some activity on that as well.

48
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:19.800
Joe Bostian: That's about it for me.

49
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:24.810
Joe Devlin: For me,

50
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:27.720
Joe Devlin: The showed up and

51
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.060
Joe Devlin: It will help when rocket uploads the source and will have

52
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:40.650
pfandel: Or hoping that everyone agrees to that Peter. I'm just, well you're Joe you're talking specifically about the GCC port. Is that correct,

53
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.090
pfandel: Amount.

54
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.730
Joe Devlin: Yeah, I mean, well, and anything else that you're doing. But, um,

55
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.650
Joe Devlin: But that I'm working on.

56
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.530
Joe Devlin: Getting better debugger support and

57
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.320
Joe Devlin: For these language implementations. Right.

58
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:58.350
pfandel: Because it could I do have, I do have an unconditional green light to have john Carlo.

59
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:05.280
pfandel: Continue to upload. His latest work to to get up for GCC. Yeah.

60
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:23.670
Joe Devlin: And I'm wondering now that I'm I saw it outspent from IBM maybe one of the IBM errs know that that I think that Peter Homer is pushing among I mean sure with executive approval and other people IBM has got a better and better VS Code.

61
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.150
Joe Devlin: Enter.

62
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.680
Editor integration.

63
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.980
Joe Devlin: Does anyone following that side of

64
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.490
Joe Devlin: IBM is work. I mean, that's sort of a

65
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.280
Joe Devlin: Nice open mainframe ish thing. Yeah, most make

66
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.810
Joe Devlin: Make as much as possible.

67
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.760
pfandel: Of the mainframe, you know,

68
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:42.720
Joe Devlin: Language editing.

69
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:49.200
Joe Devlin: Work there and then debugger is and other things too. And I'm just wondering, is anyone

70
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:55.770
Joe Devlin: Who'd be nice to have Peter. Talk to us a little bit and maybe synchronize what we're doing with languages here a little bit.

71
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.130
More

72
00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:09.360
Joe Devlin: Certainly I if I were making the first place my debugger would show up would be, you know, inside what Peter, you know, Peter, how it's doing

73
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:11.550
Joe Devlin: A minute.

74
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.820
John Mertic: No, no, no, no. Yeah, I can hear. Yeah.

75
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.390
pfandel: Um,

76
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.240
John Mertic: I guess, would it be, would it be useful to

77
00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:23.130
John Mertic: To have them have him as a part of a TLC meeting to per attack meeting here to present

78
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:29.280
John Mertic: You know some of that or is that just very specific to me this.

79
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:40.500
Joe Devlin: Looks like it's specific to ambit us at least at first. I think the ambitious people should be having a catch up meeting with a Peter. How are. And then, you know, seeing

80
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.330
Joe Devlin: Where the parts ago they are because it's

81
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:57.330
Joe Devlin: Just going to be very slick, you know, there's just sort of IBM and hopefully oh MP will be leveraging all of Microsoft and the open source world investment in this and you know come out with something that really looks nice to younger folks.

82
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.080
John Mertic: Make sense. Okay.

83
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:13.710
John Mertic: Well, maybe, maybe the if it sounds like maybe that projects takes the lead up and then if there's if it, if it makes sense then to have something, you know, a presentation or something at the tack. I think I think everyone be pretty open to that.

84
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:19.080
Joe Bostian: Yeah yeah let's let's put them on the agenda for the next the next meeting. If we can get his

85
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.090
Joe Devlin: Attention. I'll try to reach out to him.

86
00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.110
Joe Devlin: Okay. All right. Well, cool.

87
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:36.480
pfandel: Awesome. One last request on the evidence is I was just looking at the open mainframe project interactive landscape page to learn about some of these others.

88
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:45.000
pfandel: And I looked at the ambitious one in the description is simply a guide for main framers to open source. It was wondering maybe we should be a little more specific about that.

89
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.690
John Mertic: I think that probably makes a lot of sense.

90
00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:50.610
Joe Bostian: Yeah yeah

91
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.860
pfandel: I mean, if, if, if

92
00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:54.150
John Mertic: You all of the group wants to

93
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.900
John Mertic: Pull something together as a group that's fine. And then you can

94
00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.470
pfandel: All right, Joe. I'll talk to you about Joe and Joe

95
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:03.210
John Mertic: Yeah yeah

96
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.150
Joe Bostian: Okay okay yeah well together.

97
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:18.180
John Mertic: Yeah. And you can do that actually is a pull request just against the entry or I think whatever or or actually even the easier thing is, is the main that main repo. The end.

98
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:19.050
Joe Devlin: Ministry. Oh.

99
00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.670
John Mertic: If you just change the description, it'll update it here.

100
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.290
pfandel: Okay.

101
00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.910
John Mertic: That's a good catch. Nice. Good catch.

102
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:35.610
pfandel: All right.

103
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.060
John Mertic: I'm moving forward. And I'm just

104
00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.540
John Mertic: Kind of skipping to where I see people who are from

105
00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.580
John Mertic: Earlier calls on here.

106
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:56.520
John Mertic: I know fail long I guess Ingo maybe you are think you were on the call earlier this morning around Fei long, there's been a little bit of progress of

107
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.270
pfandel: Trying to work on the built environment.

108
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.850
John Mertic: I think they're working on having a

109
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:03.480
John Mertic: Discussion with

110
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.640
John Mertic: The Zoe CIC D team.

111
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.300
John Mertic: To see if maybe the least the LF portions that were built.

112
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:16.890
John Mertic: Out that can be shared, potentially, just to avoid having to build the same thing twice and just add a few extra you know accounts in there.

113
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:25.950
John Mertic: But I think, other than that it will be there's any other major updates that I'm aware of. I don't know.

114
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.320
Ingo Adlung: If anything's

115
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.430
John Mertic: replacing their, their

116
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:30.420
Ingo Adlung: Nose.

117
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.600
Ingo Adlung: Not as I would know. So from a development perspective, those guys have

118
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.160
Ingo Adlung: Been completely headstone.

119
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.770
Joe Devlin: During this this this

120
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:45.840
Ingo Adlung: cloud infrastructure center that I that I brave provided a brief update about that fail on his part off.

121
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.020
Ingo Adlung: And Adobe know now.

122
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:56.070
Ingo Adlung: I guess there will be it will be going back to provide functional enhancements to fail long but

123
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:02.790
Ingo Adlung: Generally speaking, I guess it would be good to understand where people see gaps.

124
00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:13.740
Ingo Adlung: That they would like to to see addressed. I know I'm a customer on being icy in the lights.

125
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:27.120
Ingo Adlung: They had just audit himself on the, on the, on the, on the Maris mailing list that's that they're using a long code from the mainframe project and have automated to their environment upon it.

126
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:39.420
John Mertic: Oh. Nice. Nice. Nice. We should see if they were maybe getting involved in some of the Community calls and things just to help provide feedback and see if there's anything want to contribute. Yeah.

127
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:44.850
Ingo Adlung: It was only it was only today that said one of the guys bus was actually posting on the other mariska mailing lists.

128
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.260
John Mertic: That was nice to see definitely, definitely.

129
00:19:53.670 --> 00:20:00.810
John Mertic: All right, I'm policy carefully. I don't think there's any updates there.

130
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:12.180
John Mertic: Jerry sends his regrets. I think he's a bit heads down in his day job at the moment I think during the kickoff more KSC meetings. After the first of the year.

131
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:20.610
John Mertic: bizarro I know here in I see you on in the background there. We had the first TLC meeting. I don't know if there's any updates you want to share

132
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:28.380
hiren: Oh, yeah. So we had our first TSA meeting. I'm still looking for additional

133
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:51.720
hiren: members to join this community. So we need to keep reaching out to people and and make them aware of it. And so that they can join and then contribute so yep so that's the following activities for for upcoming year on to recruit people to PSC and also community.

134
00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:14.880
hiren: Anytime we have a good set of workflows that additional workflows that IBM GTS team contributed so that would be on top of samples and provisioning workflow. So people who are looking for some good examples we are no additional examples that are shared by IBM GTS team.

135
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:20.370
That's great to hear.

136
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.290
John Mertic: Any other questions. Any questions on zero

137
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:33.630
John Mertic: All right, shifting over into the active stage projects.

138
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:40.110
John Mertic: I think just for people who are on the phone here mentorship. I think Bob, you have some updates.

139
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.660
Bob Dahlberg: Yes, we've gotten a lot more

140
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:50.880
Bob Dahlberg: Projects just even within the last day or two. We're now up to 10 projects we were only at six, I think.

141
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.600
Bob Dahlberg: Tuesday. So we're now up to

142
00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:06.990
Bob Dahlberg: 10 so that's good. We've got them from Well Joe Devlin was the first one to submit. We've got some from Viacom IBM

143
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:27.450
Bob Dahlberg: And Broadcom and rocket sent into as well. So all we were in, we're in good shape there we've got to now post those on the GitHub and archive the old ones to past so we can get ready to

144
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.290
Bob Dahlberg: Start recruiting mentees

145
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:37.230
Bob Dahlberg: We mostly difficult change from last year is that

146
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.550
Bob Dahlberg: In the years past, we've had time

147
00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:48.660
Bob Dahlberg: Intervals where we released Stephens will keep the time intervals as

148
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:59.910
Bob Dahlberg: You know, kind of guidelines, but we're looking for more deliverable or event based distributions of skipping this next year. So for instance, during the break end period.

149
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.220
Bob Dahlberg: We get the paperwork in get that done mid term we expect the

150
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.600
hiren: And then the final distribution will be the

151
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:19.200
Bob Dahlberg: Prototype that they've they've developed. So we've gotten the mentor guide done we'll have the mentee guide done in the next few weeks.

152
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:26.550
Bob Dahlberg: So we're about right as soon as we get the GitHub and she will be able to start recruiting

153
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.330
hiren: Yeah. So one question on on this part is

154
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:43.920
hiren: If we could mentor some in for for project like Zorro where they they need to build some workflows, they would need access to the POS system.

155
00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:57.390
hiren: Zero SMS. So, so any thoughts how Miss desperation. I didn't propose the Zoho project, which I was not sure if these mentee would be able to get access to the system to

156
00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:20.010
Bob Dahlberg: That actually, that's a good question right now VCU that the University. I'm involved with is we're in some negotiation with our medical schools to get a Z machine that we will offer a a LPR there to the Linux open mainframe project where people can do this stuff.

157
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:27.510
Bob Dahlberg: Right now we're hoping to even get this thing done and ordered by the end of the year.

158
00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.310
Ingo Adlung: There's a

159
00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.440
Bob Dahlberg: Lot of high powered and

160
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:46.410
Bob Dahlberg: deans and presidents, trying to figure this out. Now we've supplied them all the technical information. So I should know in the next couple of weeks, whether or not we'll have that facility, ready to go by the summer so

161
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:54.270
Bob Dahlberg: Yeah, I, I really can't we we've been working on this for 18 months and haven't gotten the funding, but I think

162
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.270
Bob Dahlberg: The medical school may provide us with

163
00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.670
hiren: Okay, yeah. Just keep me in the loop. So once we dance.

164
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:07.080
hiren: Yeah, so give me the nucleus of this we have such environment. But then, obviously, we can recruit more

165
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.550
hiren: Okay, please.

166
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:14.010
Bob Dahlberg: Find out, we're going to get this thing by a summer, you know, if I find out in the next few weeks.

167
00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:22.110
Bob Dahlberg: Okay, know that you know it's on its way. And that will have it ready and that way you can still proposal, a project.

168
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:24.030
hiren: Okay, thank you.

169
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:34.200
Bob Dahlberg: Yeah, because we're anxious to get this going. I know there's no way people are anxious and I think we're all anxious to have resources to do development.

170
00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:39.990
Bob Dahlberg: For the Linux Foundation's open mainframe project.

171
00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.460
Bob Dahlberg: So I'll keep I'll keep john posted to I

172
00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:59.370
Bob Dahlberg: He's not he's we've invited him to our committee, but he's been so bogged down with other things I've just been keeping them updated from time to time.

173
00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:05.880
John Mertic: Yeah. Apologies. Apologies for all of that, but to run things are progressing.

174
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.300
Bob Dahlberg: Well, you know, you never know.

175
00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:18.150
Bob Dahlberg: I think we're close. But I'm never amazed by the power of people that you know the screwed things up at the last

176
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:30.540
Bob Dahlberg: That's probably why land is not on the call today. Yeah, working up quotes

177
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.560
John Mertic: Yeah, it's, it's that time of year. Unfortunately, right.

178
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:48.300
John Mertic: Cool. Um, so yeah. So it sounds like Bob probably we should be able to, you know, start recruiting here right next week. It sounds like it sounds like a pretty close. Did you get your GitHub issues worked out by the way.

179
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:53.280
Bob Dahlberg: I didn't get a chance. I got involved with the VCU mainframe, so I

180
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:57.510
Bob Dahlberg: Ok diverted there and but I'm hoping to get to it.

181
00:26:58.770 --> 00:26:59.850
Bob Dahlberg: Probably tomorrow is the

182
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.420
Bob Dahlberg: Next, when do I have, oh, getting back to it.

183
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.920
John Mertic: Sounds good. Okay.

184
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.800
John Mertic: Excellent. Thank you very much. I'm Zoe.

185
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.500
John Mertic: anybody you want to speak on behalf of Zoe.

186
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:20.040
JP Linardon: JP, so

187
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:37.320
JP Linardon: We are gearing up for the one dot eight release the main focus is the installation component ization. So where we were targeting a release date. Next week we're pushing that to the end of the year, maybe early next year.

188
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:47.280
JP Linardon: The virtual desktop is what we're working on right now so fairly exciting, but we have some potentially breaking changes. So we want to proceed with caution.

189
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.800
JP Linardon: Other than that, everything is moving very smoothly and I think we don't have any concern with move a community involved mental processes at this time.

190
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.840
JP Linardon: Good. Good, glad to hear

191
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.450
John Mertic: Excellent. Any questions from anybody.

192
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:10.140
John Mertic: Alright. So as I mentioned, we have two topics that have been kind of floating at the bottom of the agenda for a little while here.

193
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:27.360
John Mertic: One was racing. Listen, I think, was raised by Matt hawks drum and I know he sort of stepped aside from his duties here over the past month or so. And this is a discussion on renewal for an incubation proc projects and criteria for considering a marital status.

194
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:34.710
John Mertic: So I think a little bit of a thought pattern here was, um, I guess twofold. One is

195
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:49.410
John Mertic: Making sure that incubation projects are you know the attack is confident that these projects are progressing and on directive status towards or directed path towards active status.

196
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:57.600
John Mertic: And identifying projects that aren't and then determine whether it just doesn't look like it's going to make it.

197
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:10.500
John Mertic: Or if there needs to be some assistance from the tack to help out. That was one half of the discussion. And then I think the other piece was around America status.

198
00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:23.220
John Mertic: For ACTIVE PROJECTS. I think particular here at he was one that was mentioned here because it's really not had very much activity over the past several months.

199
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.940
John Mertic: And whether the the tack.

200
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:38.490
John Mertic: Wants to, you know, get a little bit more actively engaged, figure out you know where this this project is standing there to help get some more engagement going

201
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:52.110
John Mertic: Or if it or if it's on a path towards America status. So that was the context. I remember from the emails. Um, I don't know if anyone else has any other thoughts or anything else they would want to share on this or

202
00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.500
How the how the attacker to want to proceed.

203
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.320
John Mertic: I don't know if I'm, I'm going to ask the same question to Joe

204
00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.880
John Mertic: Devlin did, and hopefully I'm not on

205
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.300
Mute

206
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.180
John Mertic: Hopefully everyone is deep in thought.

207
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.160
pfandel: I heard a pin drop

208
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.710
Joe Devlin: I don't know. I don't have my my my

209
00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.140
Joe Devlin: TL a dictionary with

210
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:35.220
Joe Devlin: Me a D.

211
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.370
John Mertic: Anomaly detection engine.

212
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.000
Joe Devlin: Z. The former is he aware or

213
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.340
John Mertic: Yeah, yeah. I think some of the

214
00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.170
John Mertic: Guts of Z aware, maybe

215
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:50.040
John Mertic: Former I don't. Yeah, that it came from that product.

216
00:30:52.020 --> 00:31:09.690
Joe Devlin: I would like to hear from real people, solving real problems that Z aware actually did something that merited its bulk and complexity, I guess I've been a doubter from the first time it was presented to me, six years ago or so. So I, I don't know, it just

217
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.680
Joe Devlin: I'd be surprised if it's something that people would want to throw effort in at this point in time, especially

218
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:27.660
Joe Devlin: It's based on machine learning technologies that don't represent the current boom and what is going on machine learning and AI. So I'll throw the first rock. Now, everyone should feel free

219
00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:40.170
Joe Bostian: So just as a point of information does does calling something putting something in America status essentially mean it's an active or is there a different kind of status to care.

220
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:52.200
John Mertic: Yeah, that's that's effectively inactive. So basically, um, basically, at that point, it's like the, you know, if you're familiar with Apache, the same term is like the attic.

221
00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.410
John Mertic: It just means it's not being developed anymore.

222
00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:01.470
John Mertic: The open mainframe project is a home for it, you know, just for the the assets.

223
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:10.410
John Mertic: And, you know, there's really nothing. There's no development that happens on a going forward. Unless there's like some sort of security issue that comes up and then

224
00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:21.420
John Mertic: You know that's something that can be considered from the tack to do. But yeah, effectively, it's no longer active and treated as such. I don't know. Does that, does that help answer your question.

225
00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:22.650
Joe Bostian: Yeah yeah

226
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:28.740
John Mertic: I can put a link. There's a link on a put it in the project stages. I'll just throw in the chat.

227
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:29.820
Well,

228
00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.360
Joe Bostian: I'll do a little homework I can look it up. Okay.

229
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:47.850
John Mertic: I do know there there was at least a few emails exchanged between, you know, James caffery who who runs it and making a student there was looking to do some work on it.

230
00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:55.200
John Mertic: But like I said, I've we've not seen too much activity and i think i would i would love to see sort of what

231
00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:02.940
John Mertic: You know is there folks within this project community that that feel like it. You know, there, there can be something done with this project.

232
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:15.780
John Mertic: Is it or is it sort of a project that has just naturally wound down and I think Joe your comments are valid if if the machine learning technologies that are the core of it are out of date. Does it, does it make sense to

233
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:26.220
John Mertic: Move away from that because of it, or you know, try to reinvigorate some of that in there. I don't know and i and i also don't know where the Z aware product sits currently either

234
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:44.400
Ingo Adlung: Doesn't go I don't know either. So I'm from that perspective. I can't really provide any any additional insight. So I guess the question is

235
00:33:45.630 --> 00:34:02.640
Ingo Adlung: Z aware if if if capitalizing it from a, from a 10,000 feet perspective was about it. Analytics it operational analytics, so I don't know whether they are whether there are any any any competing projects in the industry.

236
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:06.330
Ingo Adlung: That it might be desirable to look

237
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.080
Ingo Adlung: Perhaps contributing some of its

238
00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:14.190
Ingo Adlung: Capabilities or or

239
00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:24.570
Joe Devlin: I only know one linkage to something out there that got used was that I believe there's an optional component to IBM and Megan on for z.

240
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:39.210
Joe Devlin: Which does consume some amount of data from. Is he aware, have some presentation workspaces based on some of that information. I don't know anything else that sort of

241
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:43.590
Joe Devlin: Has that has that link may be other things took advantage of it.

242
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.000
Yeah, so

243
00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:58.590
Ingo Adlung: Don't get me wrong, I was not wondering about, um, any, any commercial product that consumes the aware or or or AC e data. More specifically, but I was wondering whether whether there's

244
00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:15.870
Ingo Adlung: Whether whether the interactivity is is just a a reaction to the fact that that there are more sophisticated things in the public in the meanwhile, and therefore it's it's it's

245
00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:25.320
Ingo Adlung: It's just an outdated technology or better. There's still an asset that that that people might just not be aware of because

246
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:39.870
Ingo Adlung: Repeat Itself is not that that that that the popular and and I don't know whether whether it at even ever worked on x86 or whether whether whether the reference implementation was just for z and therefore

247
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.670
Ingo Adlung: Nobody cares about it. I don't know. I'm just making up those questions.

248
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:55.920
Joe Devlin: I believe offers original implementation was non z, I think it was done on Linux or Windows x86 with a melody engine and the original papers from IBM if every search

249
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.530
John Mertic: Wait, it

250
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:07.530
John Mertic: Would it make sense to just make requests know James capris always invited to these calls but

251
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:16.530
John Mertic: You know, maybe have a more formal discussion about this at the next to next hack meeting.

252
00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:23.820
Ingo Adlung: Would be great if he could if he could give us some some some insight and advice.

253
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.780
Okay.

254
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:32.520
Joe Devlin: Yep. Proof of interest in something and proof of proof of lack of interest in something or not very symmetrical.

255
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:35.310
John Mertic: Okay I yeah

256
00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:53.940
John Mertic: I think it's I think it's, I think that's definitely fair. I'm in terms of so so I'll we can do that email for him and make sure you can attend the next meeting. I'm in terms of projects in incubation. I don't

257
00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:02.970
John Mertic: You know, if I look again back at our charter here there is a clause in here that says, you know, once a year.

258
00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:19.860
John Mertic: Incubation projects come to a boat with a TASC and then you need a supermajority to keep renewing it or if it hasn't moved to active stage I'm, I'm, I'm happy to go through and sort of catalog when projects were brought in and then just sort of determine

259
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:24.330
John Mertic: Which ones, the TASC the attack would need to review.

260
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:46.380
John Mertic: I think the only ones that this probably applies to is fail long, but I wouldn't send that would be a very complicated one to have renewed and then the other one that I know that is stuck out there for quite some time or the atom plugins, which were contributed by john

261
00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:57.630
John Mertic: Who I think is based out of Poughkeepsie, and there's been very limited development. I think on those as well. So I think that might be also another one that it might be

262
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:09.990
John Mertic: Good for the the TAC to review everything else out of that. I think I guess church decompresses the other one that came in late last year. So that's probably another one that's up for renewal.

263
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:20.850
John Mertic: Um, would it would it make sense to make sure that the maintainer is for all of those could be, you know, a part of the next tech meeting and then those can be reviewed.

264
00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:22.710
John Mertic: For renewal.

265
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:38.400
John Mertic: Thanks, Mike. I'm glad. And that makes me makes me feel like I'm not talking on mute here.

266
00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:44.970
John Mertic: I think, I think we have a lot of folks that are already in the holiday mind here or that are trying to close deals in the background wanted to

267
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.420
John Mertic: Um, okay. Well, that's cool. So I will do

268
00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.290
pfandel: That for the next meeting.

269
00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:56.880
John Mertic: Um, and then the last one we had is this project proposal that's been sitting out here for a while. I don't think we've had, too.

270
00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.080
John Mertic: much traction

271
00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:04.710
John Mertic: On it, um, would it make sense to just to kind of take this off of the agenda and just let the people that

272
00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:14.910
John Mertic: Proposed it says the Cuban 80s and Linux one of just, you know, hey, let us know when you're ready to bring this back to the attack is that. Does that make sense to everyone.

273
00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:19.740
Joe Devlin: Who was the original suggestion.

274
00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:29.370
John Mertic: I think this came from. This was a student intern projects. Not this year, but the year before, and I think Mike resonator was working with them.

275
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:42.240
John Mertic: And I think, yeah, I think a couple of the interns that came together and decided to combine their work into one project, each of them had kind of did work on one did on canonical wanted on Red Hat when they did it.

276
00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.620
pfandel: On Susa

277
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:49.860
John Mertic: And the idea was to see if we could combine some of this into a project to maintain but

278
00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:53.670
John Mertic: I don't. It just doesn't seem like we've had too much traction

279
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.320
pfandel: Okay.

280
00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:10.860
pfandel: All right, well, just for sounds reasonable to me. Excellent. Thank you. All right.

281
00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.680
John Mertic: That's all I have on the agenda for today.

282
00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.960
John Mertic: Anything anyone else would like to discuss

283
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:27.540
John Mertic: Alright well everyone gets 26 minutes of their life back. Thank you so much for your time today.

284
00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.000
John Mertic: Thank you all for attending these

285
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.660
pfandel: Meetings and

286
00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:33.030
John Mertic: Serving on the tech over the course of the year.

287
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:36.930
John Mertic: Here and I hope you all have a wonderful holidays and we'll see you after the new year.
