19178564493: Hey john Islam Halen i'm i'm only going to be able to join by phone.

3
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.470
19178564493: Okay.

4
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.150

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.280
19178564493: Hi, Janice, Joe.

6
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.300
19178564493: Hey, Joe.

7
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.130
Mike Friesenegger: John spike prisoner.

8
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.050
John Mertic: Hey Mike, how's it going

9
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.010
Mike Friesenegger: It's going well.

10
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.910
Mike Friesenegger: How are you

11
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.790
Mike Friesenegger: Good.

12
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.300
John Mertic: See Dan Horak in the background as well.

13
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.380
Dan Horak: HELLO JOHN

14
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.050
John Mertic: Let's give it a couple minutes and see who all is able to join today.

15
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.100
John Mertic: Apologize that there's a little bit of noise in the background I'm

16
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.630
John Mertic: I

17
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:29.070
John Mertic: Was supposed to attend an event to a conference here today, but I'm attending it remotely. So they're doing it virtually in the background. I'm trying to turn the audio down but also make sure I'm not missing anything too.

18
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.920
John Mertic: Much so I apologize for that.

19
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.050
John Mertic: Give it a couple of minutes here. I don't know.

20
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.850
John Mertic: What the attendance will look like today.

21
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.140
John Mertic: At a few other people pop in here, try to

22
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.630
John Mertic: Capture names a CJ Devlin.

23
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.290
John Mertic: And I see Ingo are you both doing

24
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.350
Ingo Adlung: Good. Great.

25
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.760
John Mertic: Hopefully, yeah.

26
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.190
Ingo Adlung: Mobile bites out of is doing good.

27
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.980
Ingo Adlung: Know cool not here yet but

28
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.870
John Mertic: I definitely hunker down it's

29
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.600
John Mertic: Getting serious here.

30
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:37.530
Ingo Adlung: Ya know, if I was in Italy, I would not be any any any worse because as relaxed as Ollie express my sentiment.

31
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.940
John Mertic: They see Rick trough.

32
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.640
John Mertic: Popping in here, Rick.

33
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.200
Rick Troth: He's, he's here. He's gone. He's here again.

34
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.510
John Mertic: Sometimes that's how it goes.

35
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:09.030
John Mertic: All right, well, we're about five after the hour. It sounds like it's just going to be kind of it updates meeting today is we don't have any the voting members in attendance.

36
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:24.840
John Mertic: Agenda, I think we've pretty straight forward. I can drop in the chat, just for everybody's info. It's also online in the GitHub repo.

37
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:36.900
John Mertic: We can just run through some project updates on where various one stand. I know. And then just look into some of the projects that

38
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:46.650
John Mertic: We've heard some rattling around and just provide any update that we might have. Anything else anybody wants to touch on today.

39
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.000
Joe Devlin: Will

40
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.100
Joe Devlin: Can you hear me to Joe

41
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.100
Joe Devlin: Yes. Yeah, I walked away with a lot of sort of emphasis impressions from

42
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.330
Joe Devlin: Share will will be on today's

43
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.670
Joe Devlin: Agenda or no. As a matter of fact.

44
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.570
John Mertic: We are kicking it right off with it. So we're just doing around a full project updates so

45
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.130
John Mertic: If anybody else has anything else might otherwise, let's just roll a damn business.

46
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.010
Joe Devlin: Yeah, I'll see if I can get the conversation going. I think we should kill the project.

47
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.650
John Mertic: Okay.

48
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:28.290
John Mertic: Well, I think that IBM has

49
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:42.870
Joe Devlin: Claimed all the space and put all the investment in time and to doing all the gold now at of the IBM Toronto lab and there really isn't any. I don't even know you know the tents up, but where's the party I you know

50
00:07:51.360 --> 00:08:09.750
Joe Devlin: Anybody else comment on this Jovi with us. I'm just saying. It's like, I can't, I can't really see a reason to continue it under, under the current state of affairs. It just, there's so many things that everyone who's involved with open software a mainframe has to do that. Is it

51
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.700
Joe Devlin: You know what goals can be pursued under it.

52
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.490
Joe Bostian: Okay, so

53
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.750
Joe Devlin: Are there.

54
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.290
So,

55
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:24.450
Joe Bostian: Is it that you think that it's not focused enough or that there's

56
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:34.470
Joe Devlin: No, there's just nothing. Are there. Is there an actual mission and the more that is an open mission, rather than a mission that IBM Toronto.

57
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:46.170
Joe Devlin: Language lab is doing and may do a very, very good job of but that's not you know that's not an emphasis, per se. That's just Toronto lab doing what they get paid for but

58
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.700
Joe Devlin: But, but

59
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.450
Joe Bostian: Okay, so

60
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.710
Joe Bostian: So that's for the Python interpreter right uh there's there's

61
00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:06.060
Joe Devlin: Just I mean they've claimed the space for seeing they they want to do their own implementation of Python. They want to do a client yellow VM port. They want to do their own go sort of where

62
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:16.860
Joe Devlin: I'm stating a somewhat more extreme position, Joseph and then exactly what I think. But I have to put it out there to make quality discussion is like, you know,

63
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:27.030
Joe Devlin: You can. I mean, anyone can project manage anything and it doesn't even have to be real. So are we on the verge of project managing something that's not a time

64
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:28.710
Joe Bostian: Okay.

65
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:47.370
Joe Bostian: Um, okay. So there's originally a rocket was going to use this as a staging area to upstream all of the changes to all of the packages that were based on the Python interpreter and certainly I think that's still a very viable.

66
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:57.390
Joe Bostian: You know, use of the project itself. And then of course we have all of the container based things that we're pushing out there now as well.

67
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:20.400
Joe Devlin: Is it is it does anyone. I mean there isn't a separate effort going at IBM. I thought there was some Project Office that was devoted towards getting as many Docker images already have as many thing is, or is that an ambit a stated goal that has no one else already on that runway.

68
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.050
Joe Bostian: I'm not sure I'm following

69
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:38.790
Joe Devlin: Does another person with more funding and more people in IBM run an effort to make all those Docker images available and that the amber test team and project is doing something

70
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:57.450
Joe Devlin: Hat. Um, I mean, this group still doesn't have a mainframe. Okay, roughly outside of people have them within their daily life jobs. And so the notion of doing a lot of porting and compiling testing of things.

71
00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:06.090
Joe Devlin: Where they don't have a lab. And if someone else that IBM is doing this, it seems like good effort after that.

72
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.920
Joe Bostian: So there's

73
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.490
Joe Bostian: there's currently no effort going on that's going to take the

74
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:25.470
Joe Bostian: Initiative over to publish a bunch of images that that aren't already part of regular you know product plans. In other words, there's no

75
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:36.030
Joe Bostian: There's nobody here with the mission inside of IBM to go off and say create a Docker hub with all of the CEOs images in it that that you know can be

76
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:51.120
Joe Bostian: Published right i mean that that we're trying to use the Linux containers repo for out there is to show people how to do it for themselves. And I think that's a very valid use of of the project, right.

77
00:11:51.330 --> 00:12:06.090
Joe Devlin: So, okay. Well, I suppose, we were to bounce that off of someone who consider themselves an architect and strategist of that area at IBM like you have to take. I don't take Mark vaguely. Does he know about this project and expect it to do something or do they have something else go

78
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.940
Joe Bostian: He knows about this project, but I don't think he has any expectations of any kind of

79
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:18.510
Joe Bostian: You know results from this group that that he's making any plans on

80
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.320
Joe Devlin: Okay, I'm just laying out these concerns here because it's, you know, the

81
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:36.270
Joe Devlin: A you know we we have back to you almost two years now. We're trying to do these different or empty projects and it seems like

82
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.610
Joe Devlin: Even for theoretically funded like rockets language ports or

83
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.770
Joe Devlin: Other stuff that just

84
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.640
Ingo Adlung: Yeah, so where's the army.

85
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:59.460
Joe Devlin: Does anyone else have an opinion, hear me to anyone. I mean, I know that optimism is always good. Well,

86
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:00.630
Okay.

87
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:11.700
Ingo Adlung: So, so this is saying go, I don't know that I have a particular optimism. I don't have any any any any any negative anything negative to say here either.

88
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:22.680
Ingo Adlung: But john I think it would be fair to take that to Meredith stall and and asked her to to to to decipher

89
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:37.800
Ingo Adlung: What the what the continued interest on that particular one is was an IBM that as well, specifically to the US team and and then go from there. And certainly we can we can bring in all of all of the concerns that were expressed here.

90
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:41.430
John Mertic: Hey,

91
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.820
14165293019: All right, I totally

92
00:13:45.930 --> 00:14:01.710
14165293019: I may, I may have missed the beginning part of the core part of the discussion. I heard somebody talking about whether there's an IBM effort right publishing Docker images. It was just, it was about the emphasis project.

93
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:07.650
14165293019: As part of to amp t and you that it is specifically specifically focused

94
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.280
14165293019: Around to see us ecosystem that space.

95
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:24.810
14165293019: Yeah, can I ask sort of a basic question. Do we expect the images in the same in the same way as the Linux container images.

96
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.160
14165293019: Yes, they use the same Docker files in the same infrastructure.

97
00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.710
14165293019: And so

98
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:39.330
14165293019: So what's out there now is a bunch of rest. How Tos and you know advice and things like that.

99
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:51.750
14165293019: Right. So yeah, I just want to share some of the work we do on the Linux side and maybe we can discuss how we can leverage it

100
00:14:53.010 --> 00:15:00.690
14165293019: So right now we have the IBM Linux ecosystem T right publishing Docker files.

101
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:12.660
14165293019: So we don't build Docker images ourselves, but we do leverage an open source tool that is being used by a university I think Oregon or something.

102
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:22.170
14165293019: Or you. I see. I forgot. So they actually have didn't using that tool right click on a button on all the packages that have you

103
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:41.730
14165293019: toward it and have Docker files and then to automatically build Docker images and publish the images in Docker Hub and wondering whether there's anything we can do there. Right and leverage this tool for the mechanics to get more images publishing

104
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:45.300
Joe Bostian: So,

105
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:57.450
Joe Bostian: So we can certainly explore working together on that. But I mean, to speak to the infrastructure question on you know that you brought up, Joe, I don't know.

106
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:10.110
Joe Bostian: We don't have a. We don't have a mainframe to work on, you know, right now, but I didn't think that was under the domain of amateurs to have to line up those kinds of resources. I thought those were things that the

107
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:17.910
Joe Bostian: The larger own P was trying to assemble so that we can eventually someday make use of those kinds of things. And, you know, you know,

108
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.070
Joe Devlin: I'm not saying that they don't have separate

109
00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:27.900
Joe Devlin: You know, those aren't somewhat separate problems. But one problem does affect the other in that

110
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.570
Joe Devlin: Who is not in IBM or rocket would do anything.

111
00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:38.190
Joe Devlin: towards those goals. And if you build a docker image. You've probably

112
00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.100
Joe Devlin: Been loaded and tested a little bit

113
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.760
Joe Bostian: What isn't that a bigger own T question. I mean,

114
00:16:48.030 --> 00:17:00.330
Joe Devlin: I know, but I'm just saying. But I'm putting it out there to say, you know, well, why do we put projects under project management. If they can't literally be

115
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.000
Joe Devlin: Staffed and implemented.

116
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:14.340
Joe Devlin: I'm done, bringing back impressions from share that there's a lot of happy chat and a lot of marketing stuff going on about open source, but the

117
00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:31.140
Joe Devlin: branding of things as open source versus the reality of actually having a community are at a great tension right now. And, you know, again, if people think I'm an asshole and just have to shut up for the rest of the meeting. I can also do that I'm trained and but you know

118
00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.080
Joe Bostian: Are there any barriers.

119
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:39.120
Rick Troth: Preventing. Are you saying they train you to be an asshole.

120
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:40.740
Joe Devlin: Well, both both

121
00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:42.960
Joe Devlin: Shut up afterwards.

122
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.820
Joe Devlin: I

123
00:17:50.280 --> 00:18:00.930
Joe Devlin: Again, I wonder if this is a dead horse all stop beating and I just think that it feeling like a treadmill to me in that we stand roughly at the same place.

124
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:08.460
Joe Devlin: Because the situation is changing. And it's even drifting a bit towards having a smaller

125
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.390
Joe Devlin: You know scope and also and also say that some extent you know if

126
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:17.850
Joe Devlin: IBM

127
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:27.960
Joe Devlin: IBM wants to have all the stuff running on Z my punch line here. Why don't they

128
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.970
Joe Devlin: Grants free use of a Dallas test system.

129
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.100
Joe Devlin: Do the Ott so

130
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:36.900
Joe Devlin: Just like I am, but those can

131
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.000
Joe Devlin: Actually have a reality.

132
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.370
Joe Devlin: You specifically Antoine

133
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.250
Rick Troth: You specifically means EOS you said z.

134
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.030
Rick Troth: When you say

135
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.020
Joe Devlin: Z i mean it.

136
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.510
Rick Troth: Could be Z Linux. Yeah.

137
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.420
Rick Troth: Diamond. VIOLA. Right, right.

138
00:18:51.450 --> 00:19:01.080
Joe Devlin: They can brand it make a grant a test system that could run a VC dx and have a full port on test environment available.

139
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:15.090
Joe Devlin: IBM can more at the snap of the fingers than perhaps the Virginia Commonwealth University makes this a reality and that they have the iron that is sitting in you know Capella Texas and

140
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:22.620
Joe Devlin: You know, if it's to IBM is benefit to have all of these languages and ports and packages ready

141
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:26.490
You know,

142
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.370
Joe Devlin: I would summon

143
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.870
Joe Devlin: Some more

144
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:31.710
Joe Devlin: Or funded

145
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:51.090
Rick Troth: Some ports are easy, turn the crank let the machine do the work. There is a problem when these things get. I mean, there's always some amount of funding required I run into this at my employer, there are certain platform ports that I believe we should have that we don't have and

146
00:19:52.320 --> 00:20:03.840
Rick Troth: Our lab actually has the platform to do it, but somebody said, oh, but we can't justify, you know, because there might be a cure a regression cycle implied, even if not truly required

147
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.550
Rick Troth: And things like this. Someone should turn the crank.

148
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:16.290
Rick Troth: When CEOs is involved the Dallas systems will charge. So there is a certain amount of

149
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.080
Rick Troth: funding that is required.

150
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:28.050
Rick Troth: I think the Dallas Linux systems are a little bit more accommodating in terms of, oh you burn some CPU. Well, we don't

151
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.300
Rick Troth: I didn't buy you own it CEOs.

152
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.020
Joe Devlin: Yeah, I priced it out. And I know that the

153
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:34.890
Rick Troth: System.

154
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:47.610
Joe Devlin: The minimum charge per month $550 the maximum charge is 12,000 a month. If you really just like run flat out and constantly hammering the CPUs and disks and so

155
00:20:48.060 --> 00:21:07.680
Joe Devlin: There's some. There are some number between you know 9000 or $1,000 on 140 $4,000 a year some number virtual dollars that would need to be spent does IBM wants to donate some of those virtual dollars to help being that that the project become a success. The

156
00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.170
Joe Devlin: More open were ready for it.

157
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:19.110
Rick Troth: Yeah, we need somebody to somebody with the budgeting authority to step up. I mean $500 is a rounding error in most budgets of any significance.

158
00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:26.640
Joe Devlin: Yeah, so, so it seems like compared to all the suffering, we're going through and VCU and the start and stuff that it would have been

159
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:40.140
Joe Devlin: Interesting to pursue that sounds approachable and that he would seem like with the proper whining and supplication that maybe IBM. Could that coffee and load them done. The 12,000 max.

160
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.040
John Mertic: So,

161
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:44.970
Rick Troth: Take it up to

162
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.140
Rick Troth: Market Zani

163
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.630
Rick Troth: He's been accommodating before I don't know how many times we can go to that. Well, but

164
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.340
Rick Troth: But if somebody can reach out to mark.

165
00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.320
John Mertic: Yeah, I mean, maybe one of the things that might be helpful.

166
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:03.390
John Mertic: And it sounds like there's people that know contacts that have made this happen before so

167
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.870
John Mertic: What I'm summarizing this there's there's two questions coming out of

168
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:11.670
John Mertic: Here, there's one of is there a potential conflict.

169
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:11.940
John Mertic: In the

170
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.250
John Mertic: aims and goals of the project.

171
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.200
John Mertic: In regards to other initiatives that might be already happening.

172
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:25.590
John Mertic: In a single vendor sense you know essentially that those activities.

173
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:42.330
John Mertic: Run conflict to the goals of another project to the employees projects I here. So, that is one line and then the other is, um, are some of the various projects that are hosted here.

174
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:53.040
John Mertic: In a way, setup for not appropriately set up for success because of the complexities of getting as the system is that

175
00:22:54.540 --> 00:23:00.180
John Mertic: Kind of covered the two lines of discussion pretty well or am I missing nuances.

176
00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:11.370
Joe Devlin: That that's pretty much it. But I want to go front loaded on that because you know sort of seeing where I thought, though he was going to go when it was put into

177
00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:26.190
Joe Devlin: You know, an open source project and where it ended up right now. You know, just sort of my experiences informing me that I would want to go and get her get on the right track and clear the right runways early rather than

178
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.720
Joe Devlin: You know, just assume that things will happen. Yep.

179
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.750
John Mertic: No, I think, I think those are all very fair points, um,

180
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:45.240
John Mertic: So it sounds like. And maybe Ingo. I don't know. You know, if you can help with this, if this is something maybe we should get a three way call and get Meredith involved in

181
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:47.460
Ingo Adlung: Both

182
00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:48.900
Ingo Adlung: I think we should involve

183
00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:50.340
John Mertic: Marriages okay

184
00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.240
John Mertic: Um, but at least it sounds like capturing it.

185
00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:05.610
John Mertic: Yeah, it's, it's, you know, is there conflicts between with the end of these projects is trying to accomplish and other, it seems like it's very pointed towards IBM internal efforts.

186
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:14.310
John Mertic: Is in a guest Joe Devlin, a point to you. Do you see that there's other organizations that have internal efforts that are conflicting with this or do you think it's

187
00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.560
John Mertic: It's predominantly. And I think if the

188
00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:18.900
Joe Devlin: If the scope of amateur says no.

189
00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:33.660
Joe Devlin: Create a docker images and keep Anaconda packages and stuff, you know, rolling. If that becomes the dual primary focuses make sure that everyone who knows about it knows that.

190
00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:46.410
Joe Devlin: It's that and not some of the other things that were mentioned, that's just a matter of making sure that the mission goals are well stated, no problem with that though they're both good mentioned. Yeah, I guess.

191
00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:47.760
Joe Devlin: Yeah.

192
00:24:47.940 --> 00:25:02.310
Ingo Adlung: I guess it's a fair observation that that's that's that that there could be quite some redundancy coming into it was the was the redhead acquisition, where were previously the mainframe was by by the very definition.

193
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:04.020
Joe Devlin: Of left out and

194
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:15.750
Ingo Adlung: And we see things changing. We also see that that I'll be at from its cloud pack strategy perspective is pulling in more open source project. So to the extent that

195
00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:23.760
Ingo Adlung: It then becomes just quote unquote just integrated the question of, well, here's a, here's a reasonably

196
00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:40.590
Ingo Adlung: comprehensive set of tools that have that that can be accessed free of charge. And there's the commercial version to it, and perhaps IBM need to think better than quote unquote misusing do MP for that. But it's a fair discussion to that first marriages.

197
00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:43.350
Okay.

198
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:52.980
John Mertic: Um, and I guess. Yes, I have a I'm writing these down in the Minutes mostly just so I can remember the questions specifically to tee up

199
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:04.830
John Mertic: You know, one is the does named as current scope conflict with internal IBM existing and emerging efforts and then to lack of the infrastructure holding back

200
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.080
John Mertic: Exists, you know,

201
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.250
John Mertic: existing and potential MP projects.

202
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.050
John Mertic: Is that a fair way to state all those

203
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.120
Joe Bostian: Great. Yep.

204
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.690
John Mertic: Okay, cool. And I don't mean to

205
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.180
John Mertic: You know curtail the discussion here I have a feeling we could probably go on for hours on this and

206
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:37.620
Joe Devlin: Know that was it. That was you got to it you summarized it and I want to push the question up the line to IBM. Let's go to the next up, sweet.

207
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.890
John Mertic: All right, thank you so much good discussion. Everyone

208
00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:50.430
John Mertic: Let's dig in moving at the line and maybe we can tackle these together, Adam plugins and terse decompress I know Ingo one of the action items.

209
00:26:50.940 --> 00:27:02.280
John Mertic: That you had taken a couple of meetings ago was to check in with both of those project leads and just try to get a sense of those projects is there up for renewal incubation. Is there any updates on that.

210
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:15.330
Ingo Adlung: I need to apologize. I had been I had been on the road for weeks in a row. And so a couple of things fell through the cracks and those are part of it, so my apologies, my very sincere ones, but

211
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.630
Ingo Adlung: So, I still have to to

212
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:32.160
John Mertic: Just add it as a acronym for next time. No worries there. Um, I guess, spitting back around here fail on. I think we have make freeze and eager on the line.

213
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.530
John Mertic: Mike, you're you. You might be on mute.

214
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:45.480
Mike Friesenegger: Yes, I'm on mute. Sorry about that. Hear me now.

215
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:47.370
John Mertic: Yep.

216
00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:54.060
Mike Friesenegger: Okay, good. So we have our last meeting and and things are progressing, albeit slowly.

217
00:27:54.510 --> 00:28:03.450
Mike Friesenegger: Um, you know, the, so the the the big, the big item is the CIC D infrastructure and trying to piggyback off of what the Zoe project has done.

218
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:20.040
Mike Friesenegger: And that continues to move forward slowly but surely at the same time we are focusing on how developers can get access to an environment so that they can actually develop, test things

219
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.300
Mike Friesenegger: And and and so that's being worked on with a number of

220
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:34.380
Mike Friesenegger: partners that have Z resources that are willing to share some of those resources and then and then finally we have one

221
00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:49.440
Mike Friesenegger: A presentation at our next meeting, which will be next week where I hope that will actually see a an external contribution to the project IBM has done a lot of contributions to the project up to this point.

222
00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:51.960
Mike Friesenegger: But that we have

223
00:28:53.070 --> 00:29:03.690
Mike Friesenegger: A group that has been working on on external on changes and they're going to review their contributions, with the with the group during next meeting.

224
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.000
Mike Friesenegger: Sorry, that wasn't very verbose. My apologies.

225
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:15.270
John Mertic: No, that's, that's great. And I think you're all next meeting. It's not. Well, it's actually next Thursday.

226
00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:16.530
John Mertic: At 430 Eastern right

227
00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.000
Mike Friesenegger: Correct, yes.

228
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.840
John Mertic: Okay, well that's that's that's great to hear. That's great to hear. Um,

229
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.450
John Mertic: Any, any questions from anyone on that.

230
00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.830
19178564493: Just so this is Latin

231
00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:41.310
19178564493: listening in and all this stuff. We have a mainframe with CEOs that anybody can have access to. Besides the Linux VM environment that we're also giving access to

232
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:51.330
19178564493: Mike and a fail on team to so and i also still working with VCU. They're getting closer and closer to getting their own the same

233
00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.830
19178564493: Which will be available for what we all want to do on the outside world, but

234
00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:08.040
19178564493: Our machine does this apply as a just a sandbox, so we don't care what happens in things go down or anything like that. We just bring it back up. And I go, if, if that ever really other happens just so everybody knows. Okay.

235
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:11.100
Rick Troth: My hero, but

236
00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:15.090
Joe Devlin: And what is the Viacom, what do you mean by comp plan.

237
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:31.590
19178564493: Yeah, it's, it, it's in our office, we, we just moved it from our Penn plaza office out to our headquarters on Long Island and Farmingdale but it's, you know, opened up you know give you, everybody. Anybody access that you need it. And, you know,

238
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:42.420
19178564493: It works out pretty nice for when people need something that doesn't want to deal with rules or regulations that drive everybody nuts because we do what we like.

239
00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.240
Joe Devlin: Okay. I mean, I

240
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:54.240
Joe Devlin: I feel ignorant that I didn't know that such a thing exists, and I don't even know how many R amp D project have

241
00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:57.750
Joe Devlin: You know, put a line of code there. Yeah.

242
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.960
Mike Friesenegger: So, uh, yeah.

243
00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.200
19178564493: Sorry about that. I should have let everybody know

244
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:10.920
19178564493: When the when we were all together one time or another. But Mike, you were gonna say something. I'm sorry to interrupt you. Yeah.

245
00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:15.390
Mike Friesenegger: No, no, it's okay. So I didn't want to name names. So that's why I was very

246
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.750
Mike Friesenegger: standoffish when it came to who

247
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.250
Mike Friesenegger: Are the partners, we're

248
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.140
Mike Friesenegger: Working with but yeah by climate.

249
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.280
Joe Devlin: Is absolutely

250
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:26.700
Mike Friesenegger: A great while we haven't laid down any

251
00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:30.330
Mike Friesenegger: Code, yet we are actually in conversations with

252
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.920
19178564493: Their systems programmer.

253
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.620
Mike Friesenegger: To get a second levels, the VM environment.

254
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.820
Mike Friesenegger: Configuration so

255
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:36.990
Mike Friesenegger: We're working out the

256
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.770
Mike Friesenegger: Details on a second level CDN seven one environment.

257
00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:42.960
Mike Friesenegger: That a developer could

258
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.550
Mike Friesenegger: Have provisioned

259
00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:52.410
Mike Friesenegger: And then they could actually test out the fail own code test out their changes in the field long code and things like that. So that's

260
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.300
Mike Friesenegger: where we're at in the process.

261
00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:01.680
19178564493: And guys, you can use our name in vain anytime you want. We're all in this together.

262
00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:04.410
19178564493: Thanks.

263
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:09.660
John Mertic: As a project definitely appreciate a lot of our partners stepping up and

264
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.900
John Mertic: Willing to offer space. I know Maris has offered space.

265
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.880
John Mertic: For some projects.

266
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.740
John Mertic: Especially for our mentees

267
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:22.920
John Mertic: I think even velocity in the past is offered space. So we've seen a lot of that.

268
00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:27.030
John Mertic: Yeah, I think, I think the big question that I've

269
00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:30.330
John Mertic: That I think is probably on folks is nice is more run the, you know,

270
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.770
John Mertic: Making sure we have sustainable.

271
00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:32.640
John Mertic: Space, because that's

272
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.750
John Mertic: That's why we have these things.

273
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:37.860
John Mertic: Come together but you got to start somewhere. So

274
00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:39.270
John Mertic: This is least

275
00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.750
John Mertic: It's a great thing to Viacom stepping up and doing

276
00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.600
John Mertic: Um, anything else unfailing from anybody.

277
00:32:55.410 --> 00:33:10.290
John Mertic: All right, for polycephalum Jerry Edgington was unable to join today. He did send me a note via email. He has also been working with a Lennon. The team at Viacom

278
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.670
19178564493: Infinity AND VINNY AND

279
00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:14.100
John Mertic: Others to get his us build

280
00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:18.360
John Mertic: Environment setup, they're going to be kind of a similar situation.

281
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:31.140
John Mertic: To fail long where there's going to be a distributed part that the LF release engineering team manages and then this which is sort of more of a community manager piece.

282
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:43.140
John Mertic: So I think that's moving along. And he also wanted to share that there. They also have bi weekly meetings every week. There's our Mondays their next one is the 16th.

283
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:45.000
John Mertic: At

284
00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.470
John Mertic: I believe 2pm

285
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:53.220
John Mertic: Eastern time, and I'll put in the the notes the link to the meeting agenda.

286
00:33:54.270 --> 00:34:04.950
John Mertic: And I know he's mentioned those meetings have been a little bit sparsely attended, but we really good if you have folks that are sort of interested in it as CEOs and Jenkins to come check out

287
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.650
John Mertic: I think he's really passionate about this.

288
00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:09.810
John Mertic: And really looking to drive some more interest.

289
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.090
John Mertic: Any questions there.

290
00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:26.370
John Mertic: All right, I'm moving down zero I think here and I see you in the background.

291
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:37.860
hiren: I was, I was on mute. Sorry.

292
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:39.150
John Mertic: No, no worries.

293
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:45.450
hiren: Yeah. So regarding Zorro we are having this bi weekly

294
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:58.050
hiren: Sitting committee meeting. I'm partial via not getting any additional participation from community so

295
00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:05.220
hiren: At shared though we had some good presentation and discussion regarding

296
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.360
hiren: The USA map and workflows. It is

297
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:19.080
hiren: As per the SIP share report is getting traction, but I don't have enough participant yet in zero community.

298
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.680
hiren: And and I have been discussing with john

299
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.910
hiren: And Vinny about how we can

300
00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:35.280
hiren: Affect additional participants participants in this community.

301
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:50.760
John Mertic: Any, any thoughts from folks. I mean, I think we've shared just some ground level things just from what I've seen across open source projects, you know,

302
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:57.030
John Mertic: You know, such as just sort of, you know, mentioning, you know, as you're doing a part of talks that are related.

303
00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:03.330
John Mertic: You know, making sure that we're getting meeting notes and and

304
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:07.860
John Mertic: Notices out ahead of time so people just

305
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:12.390
John Mertic: Sort of, you know, see what's what's you know on the agenda, but I think

306
00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:15.750
John Mertic: You really here. It's a pertinent of just sort of reaching the right audience and I don't

307
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:16.200
Know,

308
00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.530
John Mertic: For folks. And this is really focused on

309
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.030
John Mertic: Users

310
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.850
John Mertic: Of the Z some f technology.

311
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.910
John Mertic: I don't know if within some of your

312
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:31.590
John Mertic: Networks. If there's folks that you think just eat connected to the script that may not be aware of.

313
00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:31.950
It.

314
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.740
John Mertic: Just kind of open the floor to thoughts.

315
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:48.960
19178564493: That's, that's this is lunch. That is the challenge. How do you reach the do SMS audience. And how do you find out who they are. Is is actually

316
00:36:50.520 --> 00:37:01.410
19178564493: Even more insightful question because do SMS is part of the iOS. So, you know, yeah, everybody. So one run Z. How do you, is there a specific

317
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:09.480
19178564493: Product number that IBM could do a search and and and it shows who's using it that way.

318
00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.600
hiren: Now we start off

319
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.140
hiren: The US itself.

320
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.830
hiren: It's not a separate product. So, it will be difficult.

321
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.530
hiren: We discussed with

322
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:26.700
hiren: Our customers about the possibility

323
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.000
Of

324
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.330
hiren: Having some kind of

325
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:34.740
hiren: Use this collection in USA map there are

326
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:41.100
hiren: Concerns from the customer about allowing IBM to collect some of the data.

327
00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.890
hiren: See when that is currently on hold.

328
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:56.790
hiren: But that would have helped us to understand who is using what functional zero SMS, right. So right now we don't have any

329
00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:08.820
hiren: Clear inside when we talk to people, we learn that yes they are using this part of zero SMS, for example, network configuration or other part software management, for example.

330
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:10.590
hiren: But you

331
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:18.990
hiren: Know incoming data or are are somewhere we can go and build a list of all the customers who are using the USA, man.

332
00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:34.050
hiren: So whenever we discuss at some conference. When you are, are people looking for us MF education I bring up

333
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:35.880
hiren: Zoho

334
00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:38.700
hiren: And request participation from them.

335
00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.100
19178564493: Start building workflows and

336
00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.830
hiren: Collectively we can help of

337
00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.190
hiren: IBM, as well as other customers who have

338
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:55.080
hiren: Participated ease or they can also provide health but right now it's on the IBM and one customer

339
00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:57.780
hiren: Has done some work with us. Mr.

340
00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.050
Bob

341
00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.380
19178564493: From Zoho community perspective.

342
00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:03.930
hiren: There may be many customer who have built the workflows.

343
00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.560
hiren: But they are not have have not joined the community.

344
00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:07.890
Yet

345
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.680
19178564493: What, what kind of response. Did you get it share

346
00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:26.790
hiren: I was not direct share. But that gives us a map presentation. People who are present in the USA map, they have seen good responsible turn around.

347
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.930
19178564493: And interesting

348
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.240
hiren: USA math as. All right.

349
00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:44.010
hiren: They understand that it is a core component of us, and there is more functions coming in US American kind of getting

350
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:44.970
19178564493: To this

351
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.380
hiren: Page where it will

352
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.380
hiren: Come, it will become mandatory to run the USA map.

353
00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.530
hiren: If they wanted to example.

354
00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.030
hiren: deploys EC.

355
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.540
19178564493: Acts

356
00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.960
hiren: As a container extension on a zero as they need

357
00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.110
hiren: To me to zero SMS workflow.

358
00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:04.620
hiren: So at least be are explaining them why this critical

359
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.300
hiren: Our product.

360
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.430
hiren: Installation strategy is around

361
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:11.280
hiren: here somewhere. It's just a matter of time that

362
00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:12.390
19178564493: People will wake up.

363
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:13.830
hiren: And say, oh, yeah, we need to have

364
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.270
configured in our environment.

365
00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:19.890
Right, right.

366
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:31.290
19178564493: Interesting challenge I, you know, remember how hard it was to get people to start using zero SMS periods. Now we do I do hear a lot of people doing

367
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:40.860
19178564493: using SMS. Now we just got to get those that are using it to volunteer to be part of our Zorro group here somehow, some way

368
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:51.180
19178564493: And I think that that's that that's that's what we're dealing with. But it's going to happen. It's just happening. We want to make it happen sooner rather than later. So

369
00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:53.850
19178564493: We'll keep

370
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:58.110
19178564493: At these and now with all these logged on

371
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:06.090
19178564493: Conferences being cancelled, you know, makes it even harder I maybe

372
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:14.070
19178564493: Maybe we can offer maybe what IBM can do. Here's an idea. Maybe what IBM to do is offer

373
00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.200
19178564493: A

374
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:19.140
19178564493: WebEx.

375
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:24.330
19178564493: Your WebEx to

376
00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:33.630
19178564493: Call clients about this you know how IBM makes announcements about web access to the client base and

377
00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:39.870
19178564493: And have them come and listen to this. I think that might be

378
00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:51.690
19178564493: Something we can do you and we can do it through by common 30 WebEx lunch and learns that we conduct once a month to as a as a topic, perhaps

379
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:53.400
hiren: Your

380
00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:58.830
hiren: specific topic will

381
00:41:58.830 --> 00:41:59.040
19178564493: Be

382
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.940
hiren: Centered on

383
00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.660
hiren: What FROZEN IS NOT NOT WHAT I DO SO MAD BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN DONE.

384
00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:06.150
hiren: Maybe a couple of times just

385
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.700
hiren: Focused on workflows its benefit.

386
00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.460
hiren: How you can create one.

387
00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.860
hiren: If you don't have any experience with the workflow. So, we can have that kind of WebEx.

388
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:21.150
hiren: For my need to work at my company.

389
00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:21.600
19178564493: To

390
00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.580
hiren: To set such

391
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.840
A backs.

392
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:26.460
19178564493: Me.

393
00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:33.690
19178564493: I'm the one who led when similar to me. Yeah, okay.

394
00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.930
hiren: So maybe what you could do a form it do

395
00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:49.440
19178564493: Do me a favor and write a description of what the presentation would be about and a bio of the speaker that would be presenting and then we can pick a date.

396
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.130
19178564493: Maybe next month to

397
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.780
19178564493: Conduct

398
00:42:55.830 --> 00:43:01.200
19178564493: And and write it in such a way that it's enticing people, you know, that would be

399
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:16.440
19178564493: Of interest, you know, take your time and maybe we can go back and forth together through emails and wordsmith it and then agree on it and get it out the door and an invitation. Okay.

400
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.240
hiren: Great, thank you.

401
00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.200
19178564493: Thank you for your for

402
00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:20.880
John Mertic: Your. Thank you. Thank you. Let

403
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:24.420
19178564493: Us keep us updated on that because it's something we can also promote

404
00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:25.620
John Mertic: Out through our channels.

405
00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.750
19178564493: Really easily as well. Oh, yeah.

406
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:32.220
19178564493: Yep, yep. I mean, I know you have a customer. I know you have a big customer

407
00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:35.070
John Mertic: List, you're going to hit with that which

408
00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.410
John Mertic: So it probably maybe makes more sense with

409
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.180
John Mertic: Toronto Viacom context.

410
00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:45.900
John Mertic: But yeah, certainly we can we can promote out their channels as well. And yeah hopefully

411
00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:51.840
John Mertic: Here in that couldn't kind of drive a little back interest into the this particular project and

412
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:53.970
19178564493: kind of kick things off. Yep.

413
00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:55.380
John Mertic: Cool.

414
00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.720
John Mertic: Well, we are solving the world's problems today I'm

415
00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.270
John Mertic: Only internally we didn't get the

416
00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.980
John Mertic: big elephant in the room solved but

417
00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:06.960
John Mertic: As we can't knock them all allowed

418
00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:13.170
John Mertic: I'm taking a head here on projects at. I know we don't really have any updates on

419
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:14.940
John Mertic: The mentorship.

420
00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:19.380
John Mertic: We did close the mentorship applications.

421
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:24.420
John Mertic: Right before the end of March, the last day of February.

422
00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:27.930
John Mertic: I think you all might have probably saw the newsletter.

423
00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:32.340
John Mertic: email that I sent out and had a nice chart in there that illustrated. They're really

424
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.850
John Mertic: Really nice growth that we've seen. And I would say

425
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:37.770
John Mertic: fairly linear growth. We're seeing

426
00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.220
John Mertic: On both applications and applicants. So I think we had

427
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:43.830
John Mertic: somewhere north of

428
00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:49.050
John Mertic: 100 and almost 160 applications and a little bit more than 100 applicants.

429
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:59.610
John Mertic: Which is fantastic. I mean that's we're really showing I think somewhere in that like 30% growth, we're averaging sort of year over year.

430
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:01.680
John Mertic: So that's really exciting.

431
00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:03.150
John Mertic: I mean, I think that's exactly

432
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.890
John Mertic: Where I think we're all hoping we

433
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:07.590
19178564493: We can be. And so we're really

434
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.630
John Mertic: Maximizing that channel really well.

435
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:22.230
John Mertic: We're also at the same time. And this has actually been a really interesting happenstance through that newsletter is what were some of our past mentees were on it and we're having some of them reach out

436
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:26.430
John Mertic: And give sort of updates of where they're at today. And so I think may and I've

437
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:32.100
John Mertic: Been to spend a little time and get maybe an idea of how we can do, you know, where are they now.

438
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:33.600
John Mertic: Series here.

439
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:35.550
John Mertic: Just to really

440
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.950
John Mertic: Help showcase with the value of this program has been

441
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.530
John Mertic: Now, five years later.

442
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:46.830
John Mertic: So I think that's good. I hadn't heard from Bob today but

443
00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:51.210
John Mertic: I think the next big step there is that everyone's working on

444
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:52.440
Determining

445
00:45:53.730 --> 00:46:04.410
John Mertic: You know, assessing all the mentees and I think there's a meeting here next week, or maybe the week after to review all of the application or to review where that sits and

446
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.790
19178564493: Make some final selections.

447
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:07.950
John Mertic: So overall,

448
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.010
John Mertic: All good stuff. Any questions on that.

449
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.460
19178564493: Excellent.

450
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:27.480
John Mertic: Um, and the last but certainly not least project to touch on on the Zoe front. I don't know if there's any from the Zoe community on the line.

451
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:42.360
John Mertic: I can just kind of provide a little bit of update. They just did a 1.9 release, which is by name, their LTS release, although I think they're also in the same time still finalizing pieces of their LTS policy.

452
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:59.760
John Mertic: So that is a little bit inflate and once that lines along with updates for the conformance for her from 2020 they're looking to do more of a public announcement about both of those. It was aim for next week, although I think it might be pushed out a couple weeks is there.

453
00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.210
19178564493: Still

454
00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.370
John Mertic: Hammering stuff out. So

455
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.060
John Mertic: Things moving well ahead.

456
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.800
19178564493: On that friend.

457
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:09.840
John Mertic: Any questions or anything else.

458
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:10.560
19178564493: Anybody

459
00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:11.550
John Mertic: Wants to add

460
00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:29.190
John Mertic: All right, and then looking at projects that have potentially still out there. Um, their heads has been picked up discussion on the academic learning

461
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:34.440
John Mertic: Materials project from a couple of different angles. I think there's been interest from the academia.

462
00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:41.310
John Mertic: Folks I think Bob. Bob Burg is expressed an opinion of trying to get some of the academic folks together to collaborate on materials.

463
00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.200
And then

464
00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.380
John Mertic: At the same time there's been some of the learning

465
00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.920
John Mertic: Training folks from both ca or from

466
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.140
John Mertic: Excuse me Broadcom and IBM

467
00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:57.390
John Mertic: That are converging also on a similar project so

468
00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:13.470
John Mertic: More to come on that front the hyper ledger fabric for S3 90 there's there's work from Alex Camden, I think he's just sort of assessing what's needed, and then I'm making some connections in the background with

469
00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:24.480
John Mertic: The LF folks that are working with the hyper ledger fabric project to just sort of see how to make all these connections work. So that is still kicking along here.

470
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.210
19178564493: There might be a proposal coming here by the next

471
00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:29.100
John Mertic: Meeting and another one.

472
00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:35.310
John Mertic: Is the open source project discovery for S3 90 x. And I guess that's brought across SUSE Linux.

473
00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:37.470
John Mertic: And and whatnot. So this is basically

474
00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.930
John Mertic: tooling to

475
00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:50.850
John Mertic: Make it easier so that you could say, hey, does this particular open source project work on z and

476
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:51.330
John Mertic: It can

477
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:54.540
John Mertic: Have various different degrees of what work means is it

478
00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:56.850
John Mertic: Compiled is the upstream support it.

479
00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:01.350
John Mertic: Is it supported by a vendor is it optimized for these sort of hitting all those questions.

480
00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:07.440
John Mertic: There's some initial source code that has been maintained by the Linux on Z team.

481
00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:14.760
John Mertic: That looks like it's the basis for that tool. And I think right now. Elizabeth Joseph has been sort of leading that effort.

482
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:16.680
John Mertic: To figure out

483
00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:21.150
John Mertic: How to bring that code in is the basis, but then also how to organize the team.

484
00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.440
John Mertic: And there's been various offers that have came around, I know from

485
00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:28.290
John Mertic: Various IBM business units because this very top of mine.

486
00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.790
John Mertic: And I'm certain others as well.

487
00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:31.890
David Edelsohn: I mean, this is for the tool or this is to

488
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.300
David Edelsohn: Port more the software.

489
00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:38.700
John Mertic: This is for the tool for the discovery tool. So I don't know, David, if you're familiar with the PDS

490
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.980
John Mertic: tool that's out there.

491
00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:44.160
David Edelsohn: No prob not

492
00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:46.980
David Edelsohn: Every release that the acronym doesn't mean anything. It just went

493
00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:52.830
David Edelsohn: And this is again Linux one or this is Linux on z z iOS.

494
00:49:53.220 --> 00:50:08.160
John Mertic: I think the idea is to have it being brought across any of the operating systems right now the tooling is very specific to Linux on z, because it's designed to bring in district data. But the idea is that this should be a one stop shop across anything see

495
00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:16.740
David Edelsohn: Okay. I mean, I'll just say now since I mean I've been john you know I'm so so humble and I mean, and they don't

496
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.640
David Edelsohn: You know, not not not directed a whole

497
00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:35.160
David Edelsohn: No, no, this is this person IBM to Joseph, but I will say that this is a terrible idea. I mean, this is exactly what I'm trying to advocate against in IBM

498
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:47.910
David Edelsohn: Because I think it's a really horrible message in the sense that I think the message. My as my personal view. I'm not speaking for, you know, any organization or any, you know, part of IBM that

499
00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:59.670
David Edelsohn: The goal should be never to say yes, but it shouldn't be the goal shouldn't be to have a list of what does or doesn't work. The goal should be at all just works.

500
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:17.520
David Edelsohn: They may be. It could be more optimizing the this it but you know I really think it's a bad message for z in general to it's not Linux and Linux on z, it's not you know this package doesn't work. And that package doesn't work. And maybe this one if you squint and does

501
00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:23.910
David Edelsohn: It. I think it really creates a barrier to adoption. I think it really makes it

502
00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:29.100
David Edelsohn: Makes Z look more for it, which I don't think is helpful.

503
00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:32.760
John Mertic: All right.

504
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:38.550
John Mertic: Fair. Fair. Always, always fair points I'm

505
00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:43.080
John Mertic: I'm happy to connect you into that discussion.

506
00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.070
John Mertic: You know, just so you can if you want to add context.

507
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.730
David Edelsohn: I think I mean I'll just say me and I know we've got talked about the OH when P money before and I mean it's great work with, you know, the

508
00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:59.670
David Edelsohn: The scholarship and stuff. And that i i'm hoping to get some more money for bounties as well and

509
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:05.100
David Edelsohn: You know, we're trying to find a way of talking with an IU a day or two ago about how to coordinate all of this because I think

510
00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:18.060
David Edelsohn: That as much as we can. I mean, it's good to find out where the gaps are I think that the goal should be finding the gaps and fixing them not a goal of this is to present the customers what doesn't work.

511
00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:24.870
David Edelsohn: It's I really think that the most, one of the most important things that we could do. And I mean, people get again disagree.

512
00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:26.880
19178564493: As we're talking to before you

513
00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.140
David Edelsohn: Can tell me to shut up that I'd be

514
00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:32.070
David Edelsohn: Too much of a jerk to that, you know, what we really want is just

515
00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:33.150
David Edelsohn: Having

516
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:42.600
David Edelsohn: All of this basic part of the ecosystem works. If you do, you know, DNS install or apt get or whatever, it's just they're just installs it

517
00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.380
19178564493: Just works.

518
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.620
David Edelsohn: Maybe it up perfectly knows optimize a blah blah blah but

519
00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:49.350
19178564493: You know all the stuff just

520
00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:50.670
David Edelsohn: Is at your fingertips and that

521
00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:53.820
19178564493: Linux on Z looks just like Linux and

522
00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:56.760
David Edelsohn: Hopefully Z CSS is CX

523
00:52:58.170 --> 00:53:02.760
David Edelsohn: You know the container stuff on God. It looks just like Linux. In other words,

524
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.910
For tonight.

525
00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:18.690
Joe Devlin: If if pseudo app to get doesn't get you what you want only 1% of the Linux community can get through to you know your favorite installer not work.

526
00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:22.440
Rick Troth: Is a very communal to get

527
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:23.520
Joe Devlin: Doesn't have to get

528
00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:25.470
Joe Devlin: Yeah.

529
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.520
Joe Devlin: I'm in. I'm in Ubuntu you there.

530
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:33.930
Joe Devlin: Yeah, it's, it's clear because if you if you were Red Hat Guy.

531
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:38.070
Rick Troth: Who have red hat is never heard of them before, it would be pseudo yum install

532
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.140
Rick Troth: Yeah, whatever. But I'm just saying is that

533
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.920
Joe Devlin: Very few people know how to deal with when that fail right

534
00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:48.900
19178564493: So I wanted to divert the message.

535
00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:51.090
David Edelsohn: That, you know, I think it's good. I think that

536
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.670
David Edelsohn: Because I think we were there was a similar activity.

537
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.880
David Edelsohn: On

538
00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.140
David Edelsohn: Our and I made the same

539
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.760
19178564493: Statement to them is that

540
00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:01.500
David Edelsohn: You know, I understand the effort to be helpful to be do transparent.

541
00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.000
19178564493: Communicate to people. But I think that

542
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:08.010
David Edelsohn: Really the goal of open for a project, all of the store, or at least

543
00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:09.840
19178564493: Linux and see Linux when

544
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.650
19178564493: Everything should be

545
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:15.180
David Edelsohn: How to close those gaps. If we discover them.

546
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:16.500
19178564493: You know,

547
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:19.800
David Edelsohn: Use one of these resources or another and then figuring out how

548
00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.250
David Edelsohn: We want to

549
00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:21.900
David Edelsohn: I mean, I suppose, prioritize but

550
00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:24.510
David Edelsohn: Divide and conquer. I'm like these various

551
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.220
19178564493: People, the space, but just

552
00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:28.350
19178564493: Fix it so that

553
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.670
David Edelsohn: You don't have, as you said, either a customer doing this or you don't.

554
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:33.030
19178564493: Have

555
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.410
David Edelsohn: A salesperson saying oh

556
00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:37.860
David Edelsohn: Let me look it up on the list. And let me look up the tool, you know,

557
00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:42.150
David Edelsohn: We shouldn't we shouldn't need at least an external

558
00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.530
David Edelsohn: Public tool of saying this.

559
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:44.670
David Edelsohn: Is what doesn't work.

560
00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:49.650
David Edelsohn: It's also not there.

561
00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:53.190
John Mertic: No, no, no, it's I think it's I think it's great feedback.

562
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:55.350
John Mertic: And

563
00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:56.190
Yeah.

564
00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:03.240
John Mertic: I mean, I'm happy, I'm happy to make any connections into the discussion that's happening.

565
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:05.760
John Mertic: Right now on that topic.

566
00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:09.120
John Mertic: If David, if you're interested. I don't know where I think

567
00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.270
John Mertic: Joe Devlin. I heard you speak up as well. I'm happy to

568
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.130
John Mertic: You know, make any of those connections.

569
00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:19.860
John Mertic: Into their if you're if you're interested in, you know, just sort of understanding where they're coming from and sharing some of your concerns.

570
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:30.630
Joe Devlin: That I think all of it goes just as strongly for logging into us in in do I do, is that if it, if it doesn't work like Linux.

571
00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:35.490
Joe Devlin: 99.999% of the way people would walk away.

572
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.480
Yep.

573
00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:39.450
19178564493: Right. And so, you know, guys.

574
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:47.970
19178564493: Guys, this is land, you know, one of the things I having been doing this since its inception.

575
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:59.730
19178564493: And like 1999, you know, Linux, we always were saying Linux and Linux and Linux. But the problem that we always have is that

576
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:11.970
19178564493: You know, people still kind of, there are still people out there and that as much as he has gotten a lot better since then. But since though, but there's still some out there. And I think some of it is

577
00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:24.390
19178564493: Purposely done to make the Linux on the mainframe look different and the Linux and the other worlds, you know, the other platforms and it's not, it's, it's, we all know that it's that

578
00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:31.170
19178564493: The these is BS and open source software builders creators.

579
00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:42.690
19178564493: There, when they move their stuff over there to their chagrin and stuff works right away. The next thing they always have to worry about is, okay, if I'm going to make my stuff available there. How do I

580
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:50.700
19178564493: You know, provide you know support it and test it properly, and so on, because a lot of them don't have their own

581
00:56:51.870 --> 00:57:01.260
19178564493: mainframes nor can they afford to buy one or or they don't know how to you know get get in touch with one and so i which is a lot of the reason why you know

582
00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:07.320
19178564493: We opened the fires. For this very reason, but we did it for a few of our customers and they were surprised.

583
00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:23.310
19178564493: And and then, you know, you go back to the vendors and and you know the vendors, say, well, we'd love to or sometimes. No way. Jose, or whatever. But you know, it's always the QA and testing part later on. Yeah, I agree. And there's like

584
00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.200
19178564493: Travis CI for

585
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:27.810
David Edelsohn: The main Travis CI for us 390 X Linux.

586
00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:29.550
David Edelsohn: Has been incredibly

587
00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:31.920
David Edelsohn: Powerful probably helped it'll just

588
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:32.340
19178564493: Take

589
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:33.840
David Edelsohn: Two seconds don't want more.

590
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:34.650
David Edelsohn: 30 seconds.

591
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:36.210
David Edelsohn: Anecdotes and just half

592
00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:40.140
David Edelsohn: Past two days where I was contacted

593
00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:40.950
19178564493: Through GitHub.

594
00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.390
David Edelsohn: By somebody from the

595
00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:44.010
David Edelsohn: Rocks dB.

596
00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:45.510
19178564493: Team, which is

597
00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:47.520
19178564493: An alternative to read us

598
00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:48.630
David Edelsohn: And they said,

599
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.830
David Edelsohn: We've got this

600
00:57:49.890 --> 00:57:51.930
David Edelsohn: Patch for somebody

601
00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:53.160
David Edelsohn: Contributed for

602
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:55.440
David Edelsohn: Rocks DVD ported

603
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.700
19178564493: To S3 90 x

604
00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:58.350
David Edelsohn: And we're already running a day.

605
00:57:58.350 --> 00:57:58.950
David Edelsohn: Travis.

606
00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:00.990
19178564493: And we need to have

607
00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:04.770
David Edelsohn: How do we get access to a system to do some debugging. And I pointed them to Linux one

608
00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.390
David Edelsohn: Community clouds.

609
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:14.790
David Edelsohn: Talk to me about this as well. She knows about it and you ask those curious why did they part three of this has been happening since I guess December, January, right.

610
00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:15.570
David Edelsohn: And I asked the guy.

611
00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:16.500
19178564493: Privately

612
00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:20.130
David Edelsohn: And he said, Oh, well, we now had access to the Travis.

613
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.330
19178564493: S3 90 system we

614
00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:22.110
David Edelsohn: Decided to port it

615
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:26.460
David Edelsohn: So I mean literally just giving them access to a system.

616
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.530
David Edelsohn: I don't know if the guy is actually part of the

617
00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:30.900
David Edelsohn: Rocks dB of he's not part of

618
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:36.120
David Edelsohn: Main Facebook team, but he's prayer that community or just externally was like it was there and I decided to port it

619
00:58:37.650 --> 00:58:39.540
David Edelsohn: Yell at, you know, it's just one anecdote.

620
00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.380
David Edelsohn: But that was

621
00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:41.130
David Edelsohn: The motivation.

622
00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:44.010
David Edelsohn: It wasn't a matter of, you know, I'm a customer, I need this, you know,

623
00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:44.970
19178564493: Like

624
00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:46.200
David Edelsohn: It was there.

625
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:50.760
David Edelsohn: We could test it now. So we just decided to add that as another supported platform period.

626
00:58:52.290 --> 00:59:00.630
19178564493: See, you see a lot. It's, it's, it's, I feel so bad when I hear that because how many more out there like that, you know,

627
00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:14.040
19178564493: It really worries me because it's uncalled for, in this day, especially with the Linux one community cloud available to everybody, anytime you want to use it 24 seven for our 20 days are plenty of time for some of these places to

628
00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:18.450
19178564493: Do something just like that and and they're not especially as

629
00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:26.850
19178564493: You know, a lot of vendors every vendors different, but most of them are pretty cool, you know, once you get what they see in a while, really neat, you know,

630
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:35.910
19178564493: So I know and that's kind of what I look at our missions, one of our key points of our mission here at the open mainframe graduates is why I really like being part of it.

631
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:48.660
19178564493: Is it allows me to continue doing the work. I started a long time ago and continue my passion and do what I gotta do, you know, get out of my way. If you don't want to help. Just get out of my way. I'll figure it out.

632
00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:50.730
19178564493: Thank you very much.

633
00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:53.940
19178564493: Right, right, right. So the main thing I

634
00:59:55.170 --> 01:00:00.000
David Edelsohn: Mean for, I don't know whether it's john or Ilana who's to do it. But I think the main thing is

635
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:00.990
19178564493: With

636
01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.580
David Edelsohn: As we were discussing earlier.

637
01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:04.680
David Edelsohn: These internal projects, whether

638
01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.240
David Edelsohn: It's, you know, and you and Cindy.

639
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:16.800
David Edelsohn: Leaves team and hopefully the bounty money that I have in the bounty money that we allocated from oh MP. I think it's 50,000 a couple years ago and never spend Vegas still on the books somewhere.

640
01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:19.740
David Edelsohn: You know, plus the work that we're doing with

641
01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:30.720
David Edelsohn: The op students. I mean, just trying to figure out, you know how to divide and conquer this you know who to assign different parts to I mean not not assigned time doing it. But who can

642
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:32.760
19178564493: Work on these different pieces and just

643
01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.650
David Edelsohn: Doing a full court press

644
01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:38.190
David Edelsohn: You know, let's just get all this ecosystem covered and not

645
01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:43.500
David Edelsohn: You know, not prioritize global prioritization is just like, who wants to do what you know, just take something

646
01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:46.410
19178564493: And then try not to duplicate effort and let's just get

647
01:00:46.590 --> 01:00:47.190
David Edelsohn: It over with.

648
01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:50.940
David Edelsohn: And so, you know, I might have

649
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:59.010
19178564493: Yeah, and my humble opinion, I think we're doing a lot of that. Can we do better. Absolutely. And we're going to and

650
01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:14.280
19178564493: talks like this every once in a while, open among ourselves. We got events. We got to get our opinions out disable we gotta you know talk things out and so on. And, you know, we just keep going, Man, this. Keep going. Right. Yeah.

651
01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:18.630
John Mertic: Exactly, exactly. And we are we are happy here to facilitate

652
01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:20.790
John Mertic: Whatever needs done

653
01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:27.960
John Mertic: To make that happen, provide sort of, I think that was a little bit. The whole idea of this in the first this project in the first place is let's

654
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:38.760
John Mertic: Have the entire community working on this versus individual efforts happening all over the place that become disjointed and are just hard to sustain so

655
01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:43.410
John Mertic: You know, if, if there's opportunities there to

656
01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:47.640
John Mertic: Make where these builds are happening.

657
01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:49.410
John Mertic: Get connected

658
01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:51.390
John Mertic: To build infrastructure and I think

659
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:53.880
John Mertic: Dave, what you're saying a travesty I makes a ton of sense.

660
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:55.470
John Mertic: And I think

661
01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.660
19178564493: I think from what I've

662
01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:00.300
John Mertic: Read of a lot of this effort. It's

663
01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:02.970
John Mertic: Less of something to poke

664
01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.050
The holes.

665
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.660
19178564493: Publicly it's

666
01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:09.300
John Mertic: It's more of an opportunity

667
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:17.850
John Mertic: You know almost for that self reflection to see how we can do better. And, you know, being sort of that drastic so

668
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:33.600
19178564493: John Hey guys this is land. And I think we're at the airport, I gotta run. I'm at the airport, I gotta run. So everybody. Take care. Thanks for all the great conversation and all your hard dedication and efforts with all this keep the faith. Don't give me
