00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.350
John Mertic: Hey, Mike.

2
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.620
Hey john how's it going

3
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.810
Mike MacIsaac: It's going, how are you

4
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.260
Doing

5
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.870
Mike MacIsaac: Ah, finally doing Barry got a bit of a cold and it just wanted to hang on for two weeks. You know, it's time of year.

6
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.500
I mean,

7
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.920
Mike MacIsaac: I'm not complaining.

8
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.440
John Mertic: To say that's better than coronavirus right

9
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.890
So,

10
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.080
John Mertic: Good times, good. How about you.

11
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.710
Mike MacIsaac: How's your new year. Um,

12
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:28.890
John Mertic: You know so far so good. Um, yeah, I mean just kind of lots going on. Um, you know, lots of things in the various projects that we're trying to figure out, but, uh, you know, we're getting there.

13
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.620
Mike MacIsaac: It's one, it's one step at a time.

14
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.940
John Mertic: We're trying not to make it one step forward, two steps back. But, you know, we do the best we can, I guess, right.

15
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.060
Mike MacIsaac: Yeah. So yeah.

16
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.830
John Mertic: But no, we're, we're getting there.

17
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.290
Mike MacIsaac: Well, cool.

18
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.150
John Mertic: Um, alright, so I'm just playing

19
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.830
Phil Tully: Slow down. Hey, Mike.

20
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.660
Hey,

21
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.320
John Mertic: Hey Phil Mr telly.

22
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.020
Phil Tully: This is the first time I'm actually using the computer audio.

23
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.470
John Mertic: remarkably clear

24
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.170
Phil Tully: That's what I was actually surprised.

25
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:24.180
John Mertic: That's funny. It's funny, I actually I'm going to switch back over to my phone audio. I've been having problems with the internet here today. So I'm going to switch over to my phone audio.

26
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.090
John Mertic: In the meantime, Phil has husband Z 15 is coming along.

27
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.620
Phil Tully: We've gotten to when we're putting another one this weekend. We had some significant issue. The first

28
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.970
Phil Tully: You don't say.

29
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.020
Oh, yeah.

30
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.000
John Mertic: Alright can you still hear me.

31
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.500
Phil Tully: Yes, yes.

32
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.250
Mike MacIsaac: I was good.

33
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.100
John Mertic: Yeah. Now, I may yeah I switched over to my phone. So yeah, it's probably not quite as good

34
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.690
John Mertic: All right. I see.

35
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.830
John Mertic: Dan and Len in the background, are you both doing

36
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.340
Peter Fandel: And this is Peter fan. Now I just joined as well.

37
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.760
John Mertic: Ah, cool. I saw you. I was we've been asked to open was and that sounds like it's theater.

38
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.910
Peter Fandel: Yeah, I'm connecting from my Mac at home. Not sure why that doesn't automatically

39
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.990
Peter Fandel: Put in the name.

40
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.030
John Mertic: No worries. No worries. We'll give it a couple minutes for others to join in.

41
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.650
Len Santalucia: Hi everybody.

42
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.940
Bob Dahlberg: Hi john long time

43
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.240
Bob Dahlberg: graduations land on being a IBM Champion.

44
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.250
Len Santalucia: Oh, thank you.

45
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.260
Bob Dahlberg: But that's been no news to all of us.

46
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.410
John Mertic: Don't need the idea champion. After London right now.

47
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.620
John Mertic: Thank you.

48
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.380
Len Santalucia: Very nice, very much for the kind words.

49
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.740
Len Santalucia: And other well deserved.

50
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.510
John Mertic: Alright, we're having people really started to roll in now.

51
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.710
John Mertic: All right.

52
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:57.240
John Mertic: We'll give it one more. Do you think he'll give a warm minute and see if we get anybody else that pops in.

53
00:06:59.580 --> 00:06:59.640
John Mertic: I

54
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:14.370
John Mertic: Don't know if we'll get to him today or not we're kind of teetering on the edge of that I think we have three of the

55
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:25.350
John Mertic: Three of the seven. So if we get into more were or one or two more were there, but I don't think there's really much to vote on anyway so

56
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:27.720
John Mertic: I appreciate your popped in

57
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.080
Mike Friesenegger: Hello, Mike.

58
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.730
John Mertic: Hello. Hey,

59
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.310
John Mertic: Well, how are you

60
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.420
John Mertic: I'm doing well. Thank you.

61
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.190
John Mertic: Excellent. Do you know if Mark post is joining today.

62
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.440
Mike Friesenegger: I don't let me see if I can ping him.

63
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:48.090
John Mertic: Okay.

64
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.690
John Mertic: just popped in

65
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:39.180
John Mertic: Alright, well it were a couple minutes after the hour here, Phil, do you think we should go kind of get rolling into things.

66
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:40.950
John Mertic: That as well.

67
00:08:42.840 --> 00:09:02.400
John Mertic: Sounds good. Alright, welcome everyone to this month's meeting of the Technical Advisory Council put in the chat. The meeting agenda. It's also available online as well if you want to follow along at home, I can try to pull up

68
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:09.240
John Mertic: I don't have it. I don't have it handy with the moment, but I can pull up in the background.

69
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:27.540
John Mertic: Items for today really just kind of walking through project update there was two projects that I think we had open action items from last time was around the incubation status renewal and so that was the Adam plugins and terse decompress and I think it was on

70
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:39.600
John Mertic: If I remember the action for last time I believe Ingo is going to follow up and I haven't heard anything there. So we might need to table that one.

71
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.970
John Mertic: And then I also put in there, you know, just some of the projects.

72
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:54.420
John Mertic: That I've started to see that are potentially looking to be proposed and we hadn't traditionally done this and attack but

73
00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:08.820
John Mertic: I think it's some of these might be good for visibility for everyone. And, you know, also as a way to sort of spring discussion as well. So that was everything I captured for today. I don't know if anybody had anything else they would like to add in today's call.

74
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:24.000
Len Santalucia: Are we able to discuss anything to do with the upcoming internship program on this call, or is that not the place to discuss it.

75
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:25.920
Len Santalucia: So we do

76
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.800
John Mertic: A great question when so we do have

77
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.560
John Mertic: I do have on here, a project update from the

78
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.280
Mentorship

79
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:41.790
John Mertic: Program updates. So I think that if no, no, it's okay, it's okay. There's a lot of projects. It's easy to miss.

80
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.160
John Mertic: I was looking at it. I

81
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.840
Len Santalucia: ran over thank you john

82
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.150
John Mertic: No, no worries. No worries.

83
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.330
Len Santalucia: Um, any, anything else. Oh, cool.

84
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.580
John Mertic: Cool, I see you then. Anything else anybody

85
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.000
John Mertic: No. No. All good. All good. Anybody else have anything to add.

86
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.340
Phil Tully: Okay, well, what

87
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.290
John Mertic: Excellent. Let's dig into this project updates will start at the top.

88
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:20.850
John Mertic: With alphabetical order Amadeus. We have one of the code TLC chairs Joe Devlin on the line. So I don't know Joe put you on the spot. Do you have any updates to share

89
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.780
Joe Devlin: The only thing that's

90
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.870
Joe Devlin: Happening is I'm

91
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:32.910
Joe Devlin: As well, no, no, the interns are actually working on that project so that it's

92
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.810
Joe Devlin: Things are slow. I will say that

93
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:38.940
John Mertic: I will

94
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.440
Joe Devlin: I'll hide under a rock.

95
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.080
Mike MacIsaac: What is ambitious.

96
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:53.460
Joe Devlin: Ambitious is the language projects, trying to get languages and editors and other things on extended on the mainframe, there is some movement on IBM about which

97
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:59.460
Joe Devlin: Which language projects are being taken on internally at IBM and sort of shifting the focus, but

98
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.440
Joe Devlin: Still, the basic port of

99
00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.090
Joe Devlin: Ll VM.

100
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:14.340
Joe Devlin: based languages like climbing, you know, which includes C and c++ in a standard form is still in the ambitious arena. So we probably need to make a

101
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.550
Joe Devlin: Joe and I need to make a restatement of the goals. I think that

102
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.860
Joe Devlin: Kevin stupidly, who is the IBM fellow in charge of a language implementation for the CEOs.

103
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:31.260
Joe Devlin: Has sort of steak to slightly different shape of claims of what his department will be doing. So that's probably the the

104
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.340
Most news that I have

105
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.240
Joe Devlin: As Peter here from rocket

106
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.360
John Mertic: Yet Peters here as well. Yeah.

107
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.090
Peter Fandel: Yeah, I was on mute. Yes, yes, I am here.

108
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.420
Joe Devlin: And it's saying you have you have the same understanding right that that the

109
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:59.730
Joe Devlin: Were sort of maybe not rotating 90 degrees, but at least some number of degrees to point it somewhat different languages. Based on that, but also I don't know whether you've had further conversations with

110
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.080
Joe Devlin: Toronto about what's in

111
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.130
Peter Fandel: No, I haven't. I just know that they

112
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.850
Peter Fandel: There is a significant demand for

113
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:10.470
Peter Fandel: For Python and

114
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.010
Peter Fandel: Go to be considered first class languages on the mainframe.

115
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.790
Joe Devlin: That if IBM yeah thanks their strategic they're going to go and have the Toronto team.

116
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:18.720
Joe Devlin: Build them so

117
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.720
John Mertic: Which I don't really know. I mean, you know, this is one of these open

118
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:26.880
Joe Devlin: I would say that

119
00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:37.200
Joe Devlin: It's still a little weird, like every other platform has their languages, built by by open source cams. And at the end, the proprietary language thing still seems to be

120
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:43.080
Joe Devlin: Not quite in the same spirit of other sub projects of the Linux Foundation.

121
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:45.510
John Mertic: You know,

122
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.710
Joe Devlin: The GCC.

123
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.970
Joe Devlin: And Haskell and climbing and everything else that and, you know,

124
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.060
Joe Devlin: Seems to be the language development.

125
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.560
Joe Devlin: Rest of the platforms in the

126
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.390
Joe Devlin: world seems to be a lot less proprietary

127
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.420
John Mertic: Probably a fair observation. I didn't know others on the on the attack, and he would go to some of your old other's thoughts.

128
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.470
Peter Fandel: Believe that the Python license.

129
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.630
Peter Fandel: Allows

130
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:22.440
For

131
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:25.860
Peter Fandel: For non sharing

132
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.950
Peter Fandel: For for porn.

133
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.780
Joe Devlin: Yeah, but I'm just saying is that this thing is in the spirit of just certain

134
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.520
Joe Devlin: It's a little bit odd as a

135
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.080
Joe Devlin: As a Linux Foundation.

136
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.670
Joe Devlin: Project. Yeah.

137
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:45.810
Peter Fandel: I agree. Yeah, that would be

138
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.470
Peter Fandel: Even better.

139
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:47.100
Yeah.

140
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.110
Bob Dahlberg: So, what, what's the status of Java Oracle just made.

141
00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:01.410
Bob Dahlberg: You know the newer releases as proprietary now everything. You got to pay for the licensing.

142
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.360
Bob Dahlberg: Tacos are there.

143
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:23.760
Peter Fandel: Is going to say that they're the alternative to Oracle Java is open JDK, and I believe there. I don't know that they're forking but open JDK, you can find. And today you can find an open JDK equivalent of any Oracle Java.

144
00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:30.120
Joe Devlin: I don't know if that's true, yet I think Bob specific question might be about on CEOs IBM built

145
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:38.190
Joe Devlin: Own implementation of Java, which is very nice. They are an oracle licensee but what is their post Java eight plan, do they

146
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:48.810
Joe Devlin: Get on a bus bus where they give Oracle more money and stay closer to the Oracle main line or do they switch over all of their post Java eight development to the open

147
00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:52.350
Bob Dahlberg: You would think that Java Oracle would be

148
00:15:53.760 --> 00:16:03.150
Bob Dahlberg: You know, the fact that Java their whole reason for its inception in the first place was because there were different chips, you know, and there's a lot of x86 now.

149
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:13.950
Bob Dahlberg: You know you don't you don't really need that they have different chips, except for the Z and x86 that they would. That's one of the reasons for Java to begin with, when it was a song.

150
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.360
Bob Dahlberg: Yeah, so to abandon that would be not good.

151
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.480
Joe Devlin: Well, I don't know, it'd be another Kevin steadily.

152
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.530
Joe Devlin: Question for you.

153
00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:22.950
John Mertic: Yeah.

154
00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:23.430
John Mertic: Find him.

155
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.140
Joe Devlin: Or maybe, Mr boss him.

156
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.850
Joe Devlin: He's not on the call today, but he might

157
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:27.960
Joe Devlin: He might know that as well.

158
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.190
Bob Dahlberg: Now one of the

159
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.350
Bob Dahlberg: One of the reasons why.

160
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.490
Bob Dahlberg: People would want to go to Open Source is I was

161
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.650
Bob Dahlberg: Working on the

162
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.920
Bob Dahlberg: Linux. What is that

163
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.520
The

164
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.040
Bob Dahlberg: I forget the extended security you know where they do the

165
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.370
Bob Dahlberg: Anyway, they were

166
00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.960
Bob Dahlberg: The NSA was at the NSA, the symposium. This was a number of years back.

167
00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.450
Len Santalucia: But the security people from the NSA

168
00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:12.930
Bob Dahlberg: made an announcement that they will only stand for government use, they will only stand by open source, open source software because proprietary software they consider unsafe.

169
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:13.590
John Mertic: Because

170
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.000
Bob Dahlberg: They can't see the

171
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.660
Code.

172
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.970
Bob Dahlberg: So that that would be a reason why it from a government standpoint, that would be a

173
00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.500
Bob Dahlberg: Government contracts.

174
00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.870
John Mertic: Having open source would be

175
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:30.600
Bob Dahlberg: A reason why they would want to be belong to the Linux Foundation and the open

176
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.110
John Mertic: mainframe.

177
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.870
Rick Troth: Were you. Were you thinking of se Linux.

178
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.790
Bob Dahlberg: Se Lennox. That's it. Yeah, or

179
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.720
Piece of shit.

180
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.570
Bob Dahlberg: Well, I was with

181
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:46.290
Bob Dahlberg: Computer associates doing program happening. And I pointed out, they were making all the same mistakes.

182
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.110
Bob Dahlberg: We made with program path in 2030 years ago so

183
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:50.280
Yeah.

184
00:17:55.110 --> 00:18:00.180
John Mertic: Definitely good discussion. It sounds like a little bit. I think you're, you're kind of going after this show is

185
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:11.370
John Mertic: You know, typically the maintenance and upkeep of, you know, something like GCC, or Python or whatever on different architectures.

186
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.270
John Mertic: It's it's available cleanly to the community.

187
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:21.780
John Mertic: Obviously, there's still commercial support avenues. But there's multiple avenues available, including one which is just a pure open

188
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:31.110
John Mertic: Source Avenue and where you're seeing the challenges with some of these languages where the porting work is done by IBM that IBM is certainly the only path. You can go down. Is that is that

189
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.030
John Mertic: The agenda where you're going from

190
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.330
Joe Devlin: Right, and that and that the mainframe has been running

191
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.070
Rick Troth: behind in terms of

192
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:50.910
Joe Devlin: The up to date. Miss of versions and the breadth of popular languages implemented by going down this walled garden approach, you know, and it's just, it would be better if the

193
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.460
Joe Devlin: Code was open and the QA suites are open that people could verify that it wasn't safe, you know,

194
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.250
Joe Devlin: By public means that just think that

195
00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:00.990
Rick Troth: It makes the mainframe.

196
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.310
Joe Devlin: Sort of a you know a

197
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:04.320
Rick Troth: Backwater

198
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.660
Rick Troth: You don't get to us and pretty.

199
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:07.770
Joe Devlin: Yeah, if I

200
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.150
Joe Devlin: Take that back strong

201
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.640
Joe Devlin: To us. It makes us a backwater for language.

202
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:21.870
Rick Troth: Yeah. And the reason I picked that is because you know if it compiles on Linux, then we don't have any any instruction set issues.

203
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.270
Rick Troth: And that's significant

204
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.950
Rick Troth: So some of these things, occasionally will run into character set problems.

205
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.750
Rick Troth: I know that was true for pearl back in the day.

206
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.790
Rick Troth: I have no idea if that's an issue with Python and such.

207
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:56.520
Joe Devlin: Yeah, I mean, when Peter his team is doing the ports. They the big one of the biggest overheads of everything is wrestling with that all the different modalities of automatically converting streams on input and output or not, you know, and, and, and all that.

208
00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:09.870
Phil Tully: So I'm

209
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.410
Phil Tully: Not sure if we're going to solve a

210
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.000
Problem here are the TSA

211
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:28.710
John Mertic: Yeah, I was. I was talking on mute and saying the exact same thing filter. Thanks for jumping in the air. Yeah, it sounds like something maybe to take into discussion at the end of this project, but it sounds like what I'm hearing, at least for this group is

212
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:34.320
John Mertic: There, it's definitely supportive of me to sort of pushing in that direction.

213
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:40.200
Rick Troth: There's, there's really no way to to do that on a grand scale. It's got to be taken on a case by case basis.

214
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.930
Rick Troth: And in different languages.

215
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.600
Rick Troth: You know, it would help to isolate the issues.

216
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.660
Rick Troth: So that you can get the bulk of the updates from the open

217
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.330
Rick Troth: Source community and then anything that is specific.

218
00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:02.280
Rick Troth: Try and isolate that and not that that's easy to do. But clearly, that will also be different from one project to another.

219
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.470
Rick Troth: That kind of isolation of

220
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.630
Zero specific issues.

221
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.550
John Mertic: Exactly, yeah. Yeah, I'm right now.

222
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:23.460
Bob Dahlberg: Trying to rationalize the software that you know you're trying to get a mainframe here at VCU. And of course, I mean, ask all kinds of questions about, well we got all this x86 software is all going to port.

223
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.620
Bob Dahlberg: And it

224
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.980
Bob Dahlberg: Would be

225
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:31.140
Bob Dahlberg: Good to know what the issues are and what you need to do to port. A to Z series machine.

226
00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.040
Bob Dahlberg: Or what are the alternatives, you know,

227
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:36.570
Yeah.

228
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.770
John Mertic: Well, let's let's keep going with this great conversation.

229
00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:45.720
John Mertic: This is, this is really kind of the great lively conversation to have with this, this group.

230
00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:55.680
John Mertic: I don't think we have any updates from the atom plugins project and I believe the action item was for NGOs to follow up and have not heard anything there.

231
00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:06.300
John Mertic: I guess from the tech perspective, a lot of the discussion here was the renewal. The incubation status is the stands. They want to take is just waiting to hear back from Ingo before making a decision is that

232
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.670
Len Santalucia: Borders the tech wanting to make a decision.

233
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.970
John Mertic: I guess, Phil, I look to you for you a little bit on your leadership here if we want to wait for NGO to get more of an update from them or

234
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.010
Phil Tully: Yeah, I'd wait for Ingo. I mean, there's no

235
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:26.880
Phil Tully: You

236
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.600
John Mertic: No rush. Yeah, there was really no rush on this.

237
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.780
John Mertic: I haven't heard from me go at all.

238
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:37.260
So,

239
00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:39.150
John Mertic: Okay.

240
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:49.560
John Mertic: All right well been pretty. Yeah. So, Fei long we got Mr. Freeze and eager that can give us an update their

241
00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:57.600
Mike Friesenegger: A or or gene. So, because both James incident and I are co chairs on it but James

242
00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:03.150
John Mertic: Lead the last name here sorry did I didn't notice the James was here. I'm so sorry about that. Welcome. No, no.

243
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:04.470
John Mertic: Oh, thank you.

244
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.670
James Vincent: Finally, made one

245
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:16.920
James Vincent: As far as what's what's happened so far since the last meeting with the group, we

246
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:20.700
James Vincent: did talk about the CI CD environments and

247
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.210
James Vincent: We have a hope and dream.

248
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:25.530
Len Santalucia: That

249
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.800
James Vincent: We will be able to utilize the CI CD environments that are

250
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:33.060
James Vincent: already out there for the Zoe platform.

251
00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:43.050
James Vincent: I know that there are I've heard there's discussions going on. See if we can make that a reality. But if not, there's discussions.

252
00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:43.650
John Mertic: On

253
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:51.300
James Vincent: The possibility of hosting it in different places. A couple of the people that are involved in the project.

254
00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.300
James Vincent: Have raised their hands and said, it's

255
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.580
James Vincent: It's quite possible to host

256
00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.290
John Mertic: That kind of thing on their

257
00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.280
Systems.

258
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.040
James Vincent: We're going to, you know, like I said,

259
00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.170
James Vincent: Hope that the Zoe.

260
00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.520
James Vincent: Part that discussions in the

261
00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.330
In the Zoe.

262
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:08.730
James Vincent: Platform.

263
00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:13.080
James Vincent: Turn out positive and we can move forward, trying to arrange something there.

264
00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.150
Phil Tully: But

265
00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.350
Phil Tully: We definitely have a

266
00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:24.060
Phil Tully: We have a meeting next week to discuss them. I think it's next week, I have to look at my calendar so chock full cool

267
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.350
John Mertic: This

268
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:37.440
John Mertic: Yes, I think I saw that yeah yeah and and James I can add you to that in the evening Eastern time, I don't know, you might not have been added, but I can add you to that meeting. If you'd like a code. It's 9pm on

269
00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.660
Phil Tully: The team. That's why I couldn't find it was out

270
00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:39.870
Yeah.

271
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.800
John Mertic: Yeah, having to accommodate

272
00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.810
John Mertic: multiple continents.

273
00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:51.090
John Mertic: Came to me to add you to that call. I am not going to be available at

274
00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.050
James Vincent: That time. Sorry.

275
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.780
John Mertic: Okay, no worries. I just want to make for you that weren't available or 9pm and the

276
00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:58.890
John Mertic: 18th, you said

277
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:05.310
Mike Friesenegger: This is my tree hugger. Yeah. At night 9pm Eastern yeah yeah okay 9pm Eastern 7pm.

278
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.210
Mike Friesenegger: My time. Yeah, no problem.

279
00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:14.520
John Mertic: Okay, and I will add you to it, I realized you were not on it for some reason. So I'm going to add you to it right now. No problem.

280
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:21.300
John Mertic: I'm Mike

281
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:22.950
James Vincent: Yeah.

282
00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.210
James Vincent: If there's anything else you want to add

283
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.730
Mike Friesenegger: One to

284
00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.340
Mike Friesenegger: Two other things. One is, is we are

285
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.540
Mike Friesenegger: Working with

286
00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:32.580
Mike Friesenegger: With a

287
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:34.860
Mike Friesenegger: Number of

288
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.520
Mike Friesenegger: Other organizations that have

289
00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.640
Mike Friesenegger: Z systems and seeing if we can't

290
00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.950
Mike Friesenegger: Figure out a way to get developer

291
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.070
Mike Friesenegger: Access so that so that developers can actually

292
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.180
John Mertic: Test.

293
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:56.160
Mike Friesenegger: The thing long code and make contributions to it. A lot of contributions for you may by IBM at this point in which is great.

294
00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.630
Mike Friesenegger: But we'd love to the

295
00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.930
Mike Friesenegger: Community to be able to make contributions as well.

296
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:07.020
Mike Friesenegger: And that was one item and then the second item is for our next meeting, which is next.

297
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.790
Mike Friesenegger: Week, we

298
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.320
Mike Friesenegger: We really want to see what

299
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:13.170
Mike Friesenegger: I would love to see what we can do to drum up

300
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:14.820
Mike Friesenegger: And get more

301
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:16.260
John Mertic: Interaction

302
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.970
Mike Friesenegger: And more people interested

303
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:21.300
Mike Friesenegger: In the Fei long project. So we're going to discuss that.

304
00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.880
Mike Friesenegger: But I thought I'd bring it up on this call.

305
00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:27.300
Mike Friesenegger: Because I know that you know infrastructures, just

306
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.210
Mike Friesenegger: Service utilizing Z bn may

307
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:31.770
Mike Friesenegger: Be something, some of the

308
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.660
Mike Friesenegger: Folks on this call might be interested in.

309
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:34.830
Mike Friesenegger: And if you're

310
00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.870
Mike Friesenegger: You're welcome to join the phone call.

311
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.780
Mike Friesenegger: If you want to hear. Listen, and

312
00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:40.740
Mike Friesenegger: possibly contribute

313
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.020
Mike Friesenegger: And that's it.

314
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.800
John Mertic: Sounds great.

315
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.410
John Mertic: Sounds great. Thank you.

316
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.970
John Mertic: Thank you. Any questions for anybody.

317
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.170
John Mertic: Okay, moving ahead. I know Gary

318
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.370
John Mertic: Had to, you know, essentially, as regards for today's meeting.

319
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:17.220
John Mertic: I'm going to use a little bit of my Spider sense here. I was on a previous call they did get their code repository moved underneath the open mainframe project GitHub, so that is in progress.

320
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:25.470
John Mertic: He's starting to take a look at the CI best practice badge and he's also sort of he's also lived in the same conversation.

321
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:46.230
John Mertic: Around converting that existing Ci, Ci CD environment to a common or empty one, at least for the, the non Maris portion with that. So that's pretty much all the update I have there. Any, any questions or any or if anybody has any better updates, feel free to chime in.

322
00:27:53.790 --> 00:28:05.310
John Mertic: Okay touristy compressed I'm, I'm assuming, feel the same idea here of just keep postponing this discussion, until we hear back from ego. I think he had the action on and both of those, if I recall. Right, exactly.

323
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:17.220
John Mertic: Um, and then Zorro. I don't know if we have anybody in bizarro project on this call. I don't think I see Heron on the call.

324
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:28.320
John Mertic: I actually know they've been a little bit behind on TLC meetings, I think. But I think there's actually one later today, if I'm not mistaken, so

325
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.840
John Mertic: Maybe you can get an update after that.

326
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:48.960
John Mertic: 50 had to the active projects at. I don't think we have James caffery on the line, but I do know just from seeing some of the slack conversations that he does have an eight potential a mentee very interested in adding engine X and spark log support.

327
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.250
John Mertic: So it looks like there might be some activity going on there.

328
00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.240
John Mertic: Mentorship Bob, do you want to provide an update.

329
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:07.560
Bob Dahlberg: Sure we have 24 applicants. As of today, which is not unprecedented at this point in the the

330
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:09.930
Bob Dahlberg: App.

331
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:17.850
Bob Dahlberg: Collection of applications free we were about this many last year.

332
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.400
Bob Dahlberg: And we ended up with 104

333
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:26.850
Bob Dahlberg: We've had some probably got a flyer that we're about ready to distribute on social media.

334
00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:28.680
Bob Dahlberg: For the

335
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:31.560
Bob Dahlberg: Internship and we're also going to

336
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.770
Bob Dahlberg: Send out a mass emailing

337
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:39.060
Bob Dahlberg: To all our Member of academic members on the open mainframe.

338
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.730
Bob Dahlberg: With with the flyer and an invitation.

339
00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:49.620
Bob Dahlberg: For to have their students apply. Traditionally, the last couple of years, we've had a huge amount of students from India.

340
00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:51.570
Bob Dahlberg: In the program.

341
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:56.460
Bob Dahlberg: Which is fine, but we want to get some diversity. We want to get some European

342
00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:58.680
Bob Dahlberg: And don't understand why the European

343
00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.350
Bob Dahlberg: And the American universities aren't applying

344
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.060
Bob Dahlberg: Now we're having more American

345
00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.840
Bob Dahlberg: University is applying now.

346
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.770
Bob Dahlberg: We had some problems with the form

347
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:13.080
Bob Dahlberg: It was I was getting problems.

348
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.160
Bob Dahlberg: With it, and I think students were too. So we fix that this morning.

349
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:19.440
Bob Dahlberg: So we're good to go.

350
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:25.050
Bob Dahlberg: Now the applications are all due by the 29th.

351
00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:29.700
Bob Dahlberg: And I think once we get all the applications together.

352
00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:35.250
Bob Dahlberg: Probably on I'm thinking march 2 which is the following Monday.

353
00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.640
Bob Dahlberg: Seeing if we can't get the mentors together and this

354
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:40.740
Bob Dahlberg: Will discuss the process.

355
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.810
Bob Dahlberg: Of how we're going to pick the mentors mentees

356
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:46.440
Bob Dahlberg: And

357
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:50.070
Bob Dahlberg: The contact and go over the mentees themselves.

358
00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:56.760
Bob Dahlberg: And divide them up by what projects they want. So the men mentors can start selecting which

359
00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:01.860
Bob Dahlberg: mentees. They want to enter interview. So the whole processes.

360
00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.660
Bob Dahlberg: Week we collect the

361
00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.400
John Mertic: Information from the students

362
00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.320
Bob Dahlberg: You know their applications.

363
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.650
Bob Dahlberg: And they shouldn't be contacting the mentors.

364
00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:15.240
Bob Dahlberg: The reason why they're contacting mentors, because they can look at the projects.

365
00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:26.610
Bob Dahlberg: And really there's no need for it. They just should get a basic feel for the projects project selection and project definition is once we choose the students who are going to be mentees

366
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.720
Bob Dahlberg: That break in period which goes for about a month or three

367
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:36.300
Bob Dahlberg: A couple of weeks that is intended for the mentor and the mentee to define

368
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:48.300
Bob Dahlberg: The project. So there should be it. You know, it's a one page right now. It's a one page description of what the project is basically about and if they're interested they can apply if they're

369
00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:49.950
Bob Dahlberg: If they don't know if they're interested

370
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.740
Bob Dahlberg: They can apply for more than one project.

371
00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.040
Bob Dahlberg: So the students should not be

372
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.640
Bob Dahlberg: bothering the mentors. At this point, if you do get bothered.

373
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:12.510
Bob Dahlberg: Will put the flyer up so that you can just send them the flyer and say look at what what you're interested in. We're not gonna have any detail at this point in terms of the detail of the project.

374
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.980
Bob Dahlberg: Please apply if you're interested in the project apply for this project or our other projects.

375
00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:18.930
Bob Dahlberg: So that's where we're at right now.

376
00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:20.310
John Mertic: We

377
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.150
Joe Devlin: Are going to be clear, so

378
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:27.300
Joe Devlin: One guy has already reached out to me numerous times, and another guy is trying to find me they shouldn't be working with me.

379
00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:29.790
Bob Dahlberg: Well, we haven't

380
00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.620
Bob Dahlberg: It's up to you if you want to

381
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:44.370
Bob Dahlberg: Talk to them, but I don't really, I think, a lot of students are trying to game the system by trying to get to know you and and trying to you know that that part should really, we want to an even playing field, right.

382
00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:45.690
John Mertic: So,

383
00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:55.410
Bob Dahlberg: You'll be ample time to to work with them and to interview them and that type of thing later. But if, if you want to get ahead of the game that's up to you but

384
00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:57.900
Bob Dahlberg: Yeah.

385
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:06.630
Joe Devlin: Mostly just trying to influence some of their. I don't even know whether they'll do any additional reading. But if they were to work on the project that

386
00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.390
Joe Devlin: You know, I'm doing with the inspect project, um,

387
00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:11.760
Joe Devlin: You know, there are certain things that would be

388
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.750
Joe Devlin: Good for them to learn

389
00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.720
Bob Dahlberg: Yeah. And maybe if that's the case.

390
00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.760
Bob Dahlberg: Maybe the thing to do is put it in your

391
00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:22.290
Bob Dahlberg: You know, we have a website that they can go to the website to get over

392
00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:23.220
Bob Dahlberg: They can go and see it.

393
00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:28.680
Bob Dahlberg: Maybe we should put that information on your, your, your description. Okay, thank you.

394
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:34.860
John Mertic: Yeah, yeah, I just going to suggest that as a perfect idea. It's a great approach there about

395
00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.800
John Mertic: You know the purposes is, you know, we all

396
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.430
Bob Dahlberg: Got full time jobs you know it's it's nice that the students are interested

397
00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:44.790
Bob Dahlberg: But we want everyone to have equal access

398
00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.050
Bob Dahlberg: If they have a question.

399
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.560
Bob Dahlberg: Yeah, we can put it on the website. But we shouldn't

400
00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.820
Bob Dahlberg: Be involved in

401
00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:59.010
Bob Dahlberg: an in depth conversations with the students at this point because yeah I like I said, I think some of them are just trying to game the system.

402
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:15.540
Dan Horak: Yes, for for this kind of information because they already got maybe over a dozen of people asked me about the projects I proposed to yeah it's quite difficult to really try to communicate with each of them.

403
00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:20.070
Bob Dahlberg: Yeah yeah and and you know and I know that they feel kind of. They want to know more.

404
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:20.820
But

405
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.010
Bob Dahlberg: You know, I mean,

406
00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:30.420
Bob Dahlberg: I do capstone projects where we give them a one page blurb of what it's about and what skills they need and you know

407
00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:37.020
John Mertic: Now we could spend an awful long time and a lot of effort going, you know, interviewing every single

408
00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:40.620
Bob Dahlberg: student who applies and like I said we had 104 last year.

409
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.280
Bob Dahlberg: You don't want 104 students asked me a detailed questions at this

410
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:44.520
Point.

411
00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.130
John Mertic: Yeah.

412
00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:49.800
John Mertic: Yeah.

413
00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:53.850
John Mertic: Yep, yep. So definitely and and I think also that you know it devolves when it also helps

414
00:34:54.360 --> 00:35:03.090
John Mertic: Clear out the communication. So you're not having to tell the same answer to 10 different students, you can just, you know, if it's a good question. They have

415
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:12.570
John Mertic: You know, put it up into the the project, you know, definition and people can just reference it up there, make it, make it really simple. Yeah, that's

416
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:13.500
John Mertic: My idea.

417
00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.600
Dan Horak: Is I go update the project is

418
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.060
Dan Horak: Some old information that I

419
00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:21.690
Dan Horak: Have answer to at least some of them already.

420
00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.960
John Mertic: coo coo.

421
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:42.000
John Mertic: And actually also. The nice thing, Bob, I didn't even think about it, the application period is actually open two weeks longer than it was last year. So if we probably adjust everything through time, we're probably better than we thought we were

422
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:43.050
John Mertic: Yeah yeah

423
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:44.250
Bob Dahlberg: Well,

424
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.560
John Mertic: I will actually and debugging.

425
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.630
Bob Dahlberg: The Forum problem that we had

426
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:49.590
Bob Dahlberg: You know,

427
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:54.630
Bob Dahlberg: I've been so frustrating last two weeks that I my mood is much better. Right.

428
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:05.580
John Mertic: Data, Data Protection on Google org domain we learned all about it and not in a good way.

429
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.110
John Mertic: Not the best

430
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.340
Bob Dahlberg: Error messages we found

431
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:13.860
John Mertic: True, true, true.

432
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:18.300
John Mertic: Cool. Any, any other questions, folks have on the program.

433
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.960
Len Santalucia: Thanks, Bob, very much. I appreciate the update you know

434
00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:31.590
Len Santalucia: I give the students credit for trying to

435
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.890
Len Santalucia: Reach out and do their

436
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.620
Len Santalucia: You know, being a little aggressive

437
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:41.730
Len Santalucia: It's actually a good thing. But then again, like it's

438
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:54.870
Len Santalucia: Harder for them trying to do it to us as a little bit much, but yeah well you gotta respect their, their enthusiasm. But, you know, on the same token, you know, we have to respect the mentors time right now.

439
00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.480
Len Santalucia: Well yeah yeah and and and also being fair to all applicants.

440
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.740
Len Santalucia: Yeah. And what I'll do is

441
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:23.790
Bob Dahlberg: I'll go ahead and start send an invite out the calendar invite everyone on, you know, see if we can set up a meeting for, you know, beginning of March, if I do that, you know, two weeks out. We have a better opportunity of get everyone in line. So I'll make sure it gets on everyone's calendar.

442
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.270
Bob Dahlberg: That's just for the for the mentors.

443
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:30.570
Len Santalucia: Yes, just the mentors. Right. Okay, good.

444
00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:31.500
I had

445
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.500
Len Santalucia: An email, suggesting that this morning. Thank you. Yeah, I saw that

446
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.220
Len Santalucia: That's why I didn't apply because I knew this meeting was coming. And I thought, we just

447
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.630
Bob Dahlberg: Do it one fell swoop.

448
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:44.100
John Mertic: Very good.

449
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:46.500
Thank you, sir.

450
00:37:47.760 --> 00:38:01.620
John Mertic: Thank you again and I just dropped in the chat for everyone. The link to grab the flyer. So if you want to take that it's it's set to have all the nice bleed edges to so you can send it right to the printer and have it printed out nicely.

451
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:08.250
John Mertic: So yeah, if you want to start leveraging that in your circles, please feel free to

452
00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:21.360
John Mertic: Okie doke. Zoe. Um, I think we got a few folks from that project on the line here. I don't know if any one person was to stand up and talk on behalf of it.

453
00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:28.140
Peter Fandel: This is later, I can just

454
00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:34.800
Peter Fandel: Provide the update that I know in terms of releases 118 was released last week.

455
00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:41.790
Peter Fandel: Was a very short development cycle on one nine with code freeze. I think a week from yesterday.

456
00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:48.150
Peter Fandel: And one nine being targeted for what is the 25th of February.

457
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.170
As the

458
00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.540
Peter Fandel: LTS are

459
00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:54.090
John Mertic: And

460
00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.670
Peter Fandel: That's that's the short of it.

461
00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.980
John Mertic: Cool. Any other questions.

462
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:13.650
John Mertic: What do you think I guess just top of mind from a governance sort of operational perspective on Zoe.

463
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:23.640
John Mertic: Zoe is working to reelect its leadership group. They just closed the nomination periods and I'm going to be

464
00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:40.320
John Mertic: This excellent reminder for me. I'm going to be dropping an email out to everyone just to confirm their interest and the second is these Zoe group is working to update its logo on there were some concerns with the current one of having issues in in certain

465
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:42.990
John Mertic: In certain areas of the world.

466
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:50.280
John Mertic: Along with trying to green. A little bit more brand alignment with some of the other project logos, so

467
00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:58.830
John Mertic: If that community is voting on a new logo right now and that hopefully should close end today or tonight.

468
00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.280
John Mertic: And so they'll have a new one to showcase

469
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.690
John Mertic: Any other updates, but I might have missed or anybody else has questions.

470
00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:22.260
John Mertic: Alright.

471
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:27.840
John Mertic: Moving ahead into the projects, potentially, to be proposed and

472
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:34.200
John Mertic: Like I mentioned, you know, there's, there's been a few conversations have been putting on some of these. And I thought,

473
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:36.840
Len Santalucia: Elevating are escalating are just getting this

474
00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:37.830
John Mertic: On the on the

475
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.820
John Mertic: View of the attack. At this point, I

476
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:42.780
John Mertic: thought would be a really

477
00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.450
John Mertic: Good idea. The first

478
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.310
John Mertic: Is something that I think had been talked about

479
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:59.040
John Mertic: Almost a year ago, actually, I think it. I didn't think about having a project for hosting and developing academic and learning materials.

480
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:03.990
John Mertic: I had a student contact me.

481
00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:14.730
John Mertic: Not knowing that this was actually a project that had been, you know, considered to be proposed um but wanting to potentially dig into that as a topic.

482
00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:28.680
John Mertic: And, you know, so that, so he's kind of mulling it over and and seeing. I don't think he feels like he could do it all on his own, but he would be looking to help build a you know a potential community and other contributors around this.

483
00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:37.530
John Mertic: So I'm just sort of waiting to hear back from him. I think I might even have a call with him in the next week or two. So I get an update on there. I'll certainly never. Anybody know

484
00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:47.070
John Mertic: There's also have an interest around a project to support paper ledger fabric for S3 90 x

485
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:56.850
John Mertic: So there is a few changes the hyper ledger project at the end of last year that impacted S3 90 x one was just the change in the built environment.

486
00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:06.210
John Mertic: Which move from a common agenda Jenkins infrastructure to reduce your pipelines and so there was not native support enters your pipelines for us to 90 x

487
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:12.210
Len Santalucia: Plus there seem to be a kind of a gap of somebody just to maintain that port.

488
00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.110
John Mertic: And there's been a few conversations there.

489
00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:32.280
John Mertic: I know Alex Kim has been sort of the center of this and is potentially looking to lead this up and put together a proposal around it. But I think it's still fairly early days, I think there's still a lot of discovery work going on.

490
00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:34.080
John Mertic: On that

491
00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:40.560
John Mertic: When I know you've been involved there. I don't know if there's anything you'd want to share anything that when I stated

492
00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:46.350
Len Santalucia: No, I think you got it for now more to come, as it

493
00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:53.490
Len Santalucia: solidifies so but I think it's going to turn out nice. So thank you for mentioning it, Jeff.

494
00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:59.820
John Mertic: No problem. We're really excited. I think it's a good. It's a good effort to impact industry.

495
00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:15.420
John Mertic: Um, and then the other project, which is then kind of a, a, if I use the term a long tail project to describe something that I feel like I've been hearing discussed on PSC meetings only since 2015

496
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:21.870
John Mertic: It's about improving open source project discovery for, you know, S3 90 x

497
00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:30.480
John Mertic: There's been actually some traction on this. There's been a group led by Elizabeth Joseph with and you

498
00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:37.080
John Mertic: I think to your Boston has been a part of this and trying to help scope out what a project could look like that would be

499
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:47.970
John Mertic: An online tool that you, that could be used for somebody they could basically like type in, you know, project name and they could see, you know, read it you know with It Works on

500
00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:56.820
John Mertic: Esther 90 x or not, which destroys versions all things like that are supported. There's, there is the US court out there who's doing commercial support all those sort of things.

501
00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.860
John Mertic: There's a, there's a potential code to start with that IBM a developed

502
00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:12.630
John Mertic: That is called PDs that might be a starting point. So I think there's a little bit of a discussion there just determining whether that is the right starting point, or if there should be something else.

503
00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:23.190
John Mertic: We've been doing a few working meetings on that, if I'm happy to invite others to those if if you're interested in being a part of it.

504
00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:35.730
John Mertic: You know, just let me know. But that's, that is looking like it could become a project to propose, maybe I'm guessing here. Maybe it's probably look more like a cue to proposals by gases.

505
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.120
John Mertic: Any questions on that.

506
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:46.380
Len Santalucia: Okay.

507
00:44:47.340 --> 00:45:02.700
John Mertic: Is there any other projects that folks are aware of out there that that potentially would be proposed to include in the, you know, under a hosted project here at the open mainframe project that I might have missed or other discussions, you might be having.

508
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.030
John Mertic: Well, either. I know everything, or

509
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.870
John Mertic: There's lots of mysteries going on one of the two

510
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.590
John Mertic: No worries there. So yeah, as always, as, as you might be talking with folks.

511
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.210
John Mertic: Around that might be hosting open source projects in the space.

512
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:43.800
John Mertic: You know definitely help refer you know size if they're looking for a larger Keanu they're trying to build about it, a sustainable home. I think we're seeing some really nice track records with the projects were hosting

513
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:51.540
John Mertic: That's the end of the agenda that that I had had together here and captured any other items that people want to cover today.

514
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:59.970
Joe Devlin: Can we do a quick poll of who's going to be at Fort Worth. I'm going to be there. Are you are as well.

515
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:00.840
Yeah.

516
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:03.210
Len Santalucia: I'll be there.

517
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:05.370
John Mertic: I'll be there.

518
00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:07.080
Should be there.

519
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:08.820
John Mertic: We're gonna

520
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:12.810
Len Santalucia: Get together as a as a group from the open mainframe project right john

521
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.810
John Mertic: I think that would be a great idea.

522
00:46:17.070 --> 00:46:19.680
John Mertic: I'm kind of slightly tardy on on getting

523
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:26.910
John Mertic: Together something there are getting together at least a straw poll and maybe something like Monday night is

524
00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:30.150
John Mertic: Sort of, we're thinking just something very informal kind of after the recession.

525
00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:36.360
Bob Dahlberg: Guys, this is Bob Burg, I don't think I'll be there, but I'm not quite sure yet.

526
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:41.940
Len Santalucia: Oh,

527
00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:45.780
Mike Friesenegger: Yeah, maybe we'll

528
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:54.630
John Mertic: You know for those everybody who's in the the is using this like maybe I'll throw a message out there. We can get a channel for people are going to be there.

529
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:07.500
John Mertic: And if any of you actually are doing sessions and share that are related to open mainframe project or a hosted project.

530
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:20.370
John Mertic: Please send them to me. We want to try to maybe capture like a one pager of all of the open mainframe projects that related sessions. So if you have some just drop them an email to me and we'll, we'll start collecting all those

531
00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:27.030
John Mertic: Know,

532
00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:34.800
Len Santalucia: Gary's got one here. He's got a great one or 30 with Jenkins stuff right oh yeah he has one

533
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.560
Len Santalucia: I think there's several in the open source.

534
00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:38.250
Track

535
00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.070
John Mertic: There's a lot as though he related one

536
00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:44.700
John Mertic: Pretty heavy here.

537
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:55.800
James Vincent: Hey john for what it's worth, and for everybody else to for Boston share August the conference theme is going to be about

538
00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.180
mainframe.

539
00:47:58.260 --> 00:47:59.310
James Vincent: So we're going to focus

540
00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:03.660
James Vincent: That open things on the mainframe. So this is going to fit right in.

541
00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:08.940
Len Santalucia: Thanks Jane, great to know

542
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.630
Yeah.

543
00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:12.990
James Vincent: Yeah, if you've got topics.

544
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:15.210
James Vincent: Call for presentations open for

545
00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:17.250
James Vincent: Boston next week.

546
00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:18.960
James Vincent: So, get them in

547
00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:19.830
sooner the better.

548
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:23.370
John Mertic: Windows. Windows the call close

549
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.160
