John Mertic: I see Ingo popping in

57
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:11.130
John Mertic: If I count up my things right. I think I've got it right. All right. We've got a we have a very good group and turn out today for

58
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:32.220
John Mertic: Today's TLC call or attack call. Thank you all very much for being in attendance. I'll put the chat. I'll put the agenda in the chat. It's also up on GitHub as well. I will drop the URL in

59
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.100
John Mertic: Those following at home.

60
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.560
John Mertic: Okay, sure. Want to follow.

61
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:49.050
John Mertic: And we don't have really too much in terms of specials today. I think the biggest thing is we have a few of our projects.

62
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.690
John Mertic: In the incubation stage.

63
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.400
John Mertic: That we want to discuss around the renewal. The incubation status.

64
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.810
Vincent Terrone: And just sort of

65
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.810
John Mertic: And so I think those are sort of the big things. I think there

66
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.480
John Mertic: Was also an option there and discussing sort of the project activity and

67
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:14.370
John Mertic: Ed, but that's really I think those are all the things agenda wise. Anything else anyone would like to add to the agenda today.

68
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.930
John Mertic: Okay.

69
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:24.360
John Mertic: Oh, sorry.

70
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.390
16149350844: I got a life. Yeah, I got a licensing question.

71
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.300
16149350844: Maybe put it at the end of we have time for.

72
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.640
16149350844: Sure, I'm happy to

73
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.290
Enyu Wang: Hey john it's a new year. Happy New Year.

74
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.060
John Mertic: Happy New Year to year two.

75
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.930
Yeah.

76
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:52.920
Enyu Wang: I missed a couple of previous meetings. I'm not sure if we discussed the status on on you know getting Travis CI to support z.

77
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.330
John Mertic: I

78
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.650
Enyu Wang: Am status to share

79
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.860
John Mertic: Okay, I will. I'll put that on the agenda here as well.

80
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.580
John Mertic: Okay, okay.

81
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:22.710
John Mertic: Alright, well, we'll go through the project updates and there's a few of them here. We want to discuss renewing the incubation status and I guess just to give everyone sort of context before we we kind of

82
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.360
John Mertic: Dig into that.

83
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:41.820
John Mertic: I'm one of the one of sort of the pieces of the life cycle and I'll put the put the link to the life cycle in the in the chat here for everyone to look at is that for projects that are at the incubation stage.

84
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.200
John Mertic: Every 12 months the tack will vote to basically continue to renew it at that stage.

85
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.720
John Mertic: For another 12 months.

86
00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:11.370
John Mertic: And really it's it's not meant to be a this is a good project. This is a bad project. It's more of just to kind of gauge on at least what we see how a lot of other tasks that have similar processes. Look at it, it's more of a gauge of process and

87
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:30.120
John Mertic: You know whether whether whether the, the group, you know, based upon why the project was accepted initially is there been traction. Is there, is there a promise is there may be opportunities to help get it back going if it's slow down is the right level of traction continued

88
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:38.640
John Mertic: You know, kind of, so on so forth there. So, you know, certainly with some of these. I think they're we've, we've got a few questions over the email list.

89
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.200
John Mertic: Of, you know, hey, is this really feeling like an active project. Is this something we need to discuss

90
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:54.060
John Mertic: We certainly don't want to make it of is, you know, if you're not perfect right now you're getting voted off the island. It's more of, is this an area where the tack should help get involved, maybe invest some time.

91
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.660
John Mertic: And see if there's maybe an opportunity to to help move this project along into the active stage.

92
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:08.070
John Mertic: Does that help, I just want to start by adding that context is that, does that help everyone is we're starting to think about this.

93
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:09.990
Yeah.

94
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.690
pfandel: Cool and

95
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:20.010
John Mertic: I will say there is no right and wrong answers to renewing and

96
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:27.930
John Mertic: This is probably also an area where I think the tack could develop a little bit of case law of how they sort of look at these scenarios. So

97
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:39.300
John Mertic: You know, for example, they might, you know, you could help set sort of the criteria here of what you know looks like is going to be viability and then use that is a judgment for for future projects as well so

98
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.720
John Mertic: It. We try not to legislate things too much and the get go. We'd like to really like the tax sort of own this process.

99
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:55.020
pfandel: It might be helpful when you when you list the projects here to put in parentheses, the months of renewal, so we know when that's coming up for each one of these

100
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.070
John Mertic: That is a great idea. I will definitely do that going forward.

101
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.740
John Mertic: Thank you. Thank you for that.

102
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:18.300
John Mertic: I did for. There's three of them that are up for renewal, but we're gonna just do everything alphabetically. And then we'll talk about the renewal status and we get in there. Um, let's start with the incubating with Amadeus any updates. I think Joe Boston and

103
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:24.300
John Mertic: Peter on the line there. And I think Joe Devlin, as well as your devil in Boston to the project chairs.

104
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:31.680
pfandel: So we did have a demo earlier this week from anaconda.org

105
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:40.530
pfandel: Of their this new Anaconda server offering that they have which will be part of our

106
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.750
pfandel: Strategy.

107
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.790
pfandel: For delivering into blowing

108
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:54.240
pfandel: The fruits of impetus to our paying customers is sort of part of our

109
00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:06.780
pfandel: Part of our plan to make it a viable business. So that's an important step forward, it will be evaluating that code that that server technology server product.

110
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:08.580
pfandel: Rocket

111
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.880
pfandel: Network in the coming weeks.

112
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:27.870
Joe Bostian: Yeah, and in from sort of the example and how to part of, you know, our attitudes outreach. We're continuing to put some content in there. I'm just, just to show how

113
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:36.330
Joe Bostian: You know, open source project a, you know, can easily operate in the zoo is environment as well so

114
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:49.710
Joe Bostian: We're continuing to enhance the content that we make available there and use it as a reference to to point people at and say, here's a, you know, when we talked to them. We have a place. Now we can point people to and say, Go look over here for more information.

115
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:50.880
And that's very helpful.

116
00:11:51.960 --> 00:12:13.050
pfandel: And one a third update is that john Carlo Frick's like the guy who has been doing the GCC port was taken off the project for three months in the fourth quarter, but he is back on full time as of last week and will continue to be on full time.

117
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:24.210
pfandel: Until the end of August 20 goes back to school and we have a we've already hired a replacement for john Carlos, it will be a long period of overlap between the two of them.

118
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.370
Joe Devlin: Peter. When did you say he would be with rocket until when

119
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.620
pfandel: Until the end of August.

120
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:39.210
Joe Devlin: Okay, good. So yeah, so I think we'll be done with the debugger projects by then, hopefully, some other things. All right.

121
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:53.460
John Mertic: Great. And I think another thing that project is really working on is, you know, just kind of helping sort of established where

122
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.180
John Mertic: The ports are in the life cycle.

123
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:04.260
John Mertic: And, you know, really, you know, helping identify potentially new

124
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.510
pfandel: Things as well. There's been a lot of kind of governance.

125
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.120
John Mertic: Lead related work that's been going on there, since it's a little bit of

126
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.320
A unique project.

127
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.210
John Mertic: But I think

128
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.430
John Mertic: That's starting to come together.

129
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.770
John Mertic: Slowly but surely

130
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:18.930
John Mertic: So that's a really positive sign

131
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.050
John Mertic: All right. Anybody else, any other questions on on that.

132
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:37.290
John Mertic: Okay, next up on was it somebody else join in the background there. I see. I think an extra 804 number

133
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.330
John Mertic: Or is that somebody may be just dialing in

134
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.020
pfandel: Okay, who is area code 804

135
00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.610
John Mertic: Yeah. Is there an area code 804 person dialed in.

136
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.380
18049181726: Land settled. Ah.

137
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.730
John Mertic: I should recognize that number by now. My bad, sorry about that.

138
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.380
No worries.

139
00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.750
18049181726: Okay, our

140
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:28.200
John Mertic: next panelist is the atoms plugins jar, which is not hasn't joined the call. This is a project that is up for renewal I'm I can bring up a little bit of the on the shared screen here, maybe a little bit of where the dev analytics is his sat around

141
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.050
John Mertic: This project.

142
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.280
Joe Devlin: What name that you said it was associated with that.

143
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:36.690
John Mertic: John R1.

144
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.270
Joe Devlin: Or away from my DVR way.

145
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.830
John Mertic: Yep, from IBM. Yep. Okay.

146
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.100
John Mertic: So bring up sort of the dev analytics of where this project has sad.

147
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.510
John Mertic: So really, a lot of this was maintaining a bunch of language syntax highlighting

148
00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:01.320
John Mertic: For for the atom plug for the atom editor for Mary see VM tools. I think there was like Rex.

149
00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.220
John Mertic: And a few other back ends there as well.

150
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:20.310
John Mertic: As you can see, there's a lot of activity. I think early on, and there was a little bit of a pickup at the beginning of the year, but I think there was more of just kind of cleaning up some of the repositories, but otherwise it's been pretty quiet.

151
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:36.450
John Mertic: And really not a ton of commits here. Now, you could also probably make the argument that like how much active development. Do you have a language syntax highlighting. Um, but I guess it just sort of curious, have you know from this group like what

152
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:52.650
John Mertic: Does it, does it make sense to push room for renewing this, does it make sense to maybe look at push an active status. Does it make sense to see if maybe helping build some of the scope to get a little bit more attention to it or what are your thoughts.

153
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:05.070
John Mertic: I'll put in the chat. If you want to look at some of the dev analytics on this as well.

154
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.380
John Mertic: Your own machine.

155
00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:17.850
Ingo Adlung: So I must admit Pegasus and go, so I must admit that that that that somehow it is past my attention so

156
00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:37.410
Ingo Adlung: So, so my apologies for that. But other than that, I think, probably we should talk to john and and and get his perspective. So I don't know whether whether silence translates to, there's no there's no usage or whether it means that

157
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.650
Ingo Adlung: It's a, it's a completed work.

158
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:41.700
Yeah.

159
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:55.260
Ingo Adlung: I would assume that that that that CPM adding adding new capabilities. Every once in a while, by SBS it would naturally suggest for for for some additional

160
00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:05.220
Ingo Adlung: Additions but I may be wrong. Perhaps this is just about the language syntax and and not that much about any specific CDN commands or so.

161
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:06.990
Yeah.

162
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:17.400
Phil Tully: Good you both think though didn't go with this. So I think that's the kind of that that discussion is the exact discussion. I think we have to have for any of these

163
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:28.380
Phil Tully: Projects, we, I think we need to reach out to the project's themselves and say, you know, are you doing anything. Are you not from again from the, from the THC point of view.

164
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:38.100
Phil Tully: Let's, let's, reach out to them and say, Look, you're. What are you doing with your project is it is done is it's not dog is it

165
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.800
Phil Tully: Let's, let's, I think.

166
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:51.030
Phil Tully: We have a PhD. I don't think we should just say, oh, let's go put it into the status for that status without reaching out to now they don't respond, that's a separate issue so

167
00:17:51.630 --> 00:18:03.570
Phil Tully: But I think, yeah, right. You're right. Maybe this is is completed, it's going to be. And it's just being used and that's that's a good project until something else needs to be done to it so

168
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:14.910
John Mertic: Yeah. And some of those, like, I mean, if you look at the life cycle. I mean, this is a little bit of what the marital status is sort of for me. It's not that we we wipe the earth of it, it's just

169
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:25.470
John Mertic: It's no longer be active element if there's a security or whatever. Anything that pops up. Yeah, we look and merge it in, but it's not it's not considered an active work.

170
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.770
Phil Tully: You don't want to throw it away, you just you.

171
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.020
Phil Tully: Exactly where it needs to be exactly

172
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:42.000
Ingo Adlung: So john I can take to do TALKING TO JOHN. JOHN RV and

173
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:43.770
John Mertic: Or

174
00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:52.860
Ingo Adlung: And depending on his input, I might suggest it's fun for him to come here to the to the TC and discuss with us or or perhaps it's it's

175
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.190
It's, it's

176
00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.450
Ingo Adlung: Very clear and and we can then just act on it.

177
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.290
John Mertic: Perfect. Now, I was going to ask you to do that. So thank you for volunteering.

178
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:13.920
John Mertic: Alright, next project update is fail on and it's also up for renewal status.

179
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:25.860
John Mertic: But I think this is one here that is actually we're actually seeing a ton of activity on. Is there anybody from that group that's on the call, or else I can maybe share an update.

180
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:42.270
John Mertic: Alright, I guess I'll, I'll share the update. Um so Mike freeze and agar, and James Vincent from velocity software have been leading this project.

181
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.050
John Mertic: The biggest thing they've been focused really on

182
00:19:47.160 --> 00:20:01.620
John Mertic: Two big things one is on infrastructure and getting a kind of before this project had the CIC D environment that was really kind of behind the IBM firewall and how do we get this out to be a community CI CD infrastructure.

183
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:21.360
John Mertic: So we've had a couple of conversations, it looks like we're we're leaning towards and we're, we need to kind of circle the wagons, a little bit with a few of the folks in the Zoe side is kind of transitioning the built Zoe infrastructure into a common open mainframe project infrastructure.

184
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.960
John Mertic: With the only slight exception of that is

185
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.640
John Mertic: The Zoe has

186
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.040
John Mertic: Builders that are on Jenkins.

187
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.240
John Mertic: That are builder, you know, builders that are on Maris boxes.

188
00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:41.190
John Mertic: Those would be sort of maintained a little bit independently and so it'd be up to each project to find out you know what Z builders, they would need to use

189
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:50.250
John Mertic: But we would have a common Jim Jenkins infrastructure that would be kind of the center point is that, and I think, in principle, most people on the same page, there's a couple little wrinkles

190
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.940
John Mertic: That we need to work out but

191
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.140
12486306135: I think that's it.

192
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:56.820
John Mertic: Looks like a little bit of the plan moving

193
00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:04.710
John Mertic: Forward here. And I think this can be a positive thing for the project in general just because as new projects come online any a CI CD structure.

194
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:17.040
John Mertic: We don't just spin up one from scratch, we can you know just give them access to what we have already which has Jenkins and artifacts. And so in our cloud and all of those bits in there ready to roll.

195
00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:29.880
John Mertic: For the Z infrastructure piece until the VC infrastructure is up and going, I believe they're looking to use some resources for Viacom infinity.

196
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:37.290
John Mertic: To get going with. And so we're having, there's a few conversations on the links to make there. So I think that's one

197
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:50.490
John Mertic: Two is there's a conversation of just getting a sandbox environment for development that was kicked off today. And I think that's moving. I think that's going to be kind of hand in hand a little bit with the build targets.

198
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:52.410
12486306135: And then three is

199
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.660
John Mertic: That project is working on

200
00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:02.550
John Mertic: The CI badge, which is one of the big requirements for graduation to the active stage, um,

201
00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.230
John Mertic: So that's that anybody else that

202
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.280
John Mertic: Have anything to add to that, or things that I invited Mr got wrong.

203
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:18.240
18049181726: I think you captured it all from our morning call Jen very well. Okay.

204
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.380
John Mertic: Cool, cool. Thank you.

205
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.030
John Mertic: Um,

206
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:33.690
John Mertic: So I guess the big question on this one here is, is it cool to renew this this is up and it's 12 months already does Phil, do you think this is one we could take to a vote of the tech here really quick to renew

207
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:40.500
Phil Tully: Yeah, I don't think there's a problem is they have active, active they have activity going on constantly so

208
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.150
Phil Tully: Okay, we should be able to vote on this one.

209
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:45.960
Phil Tully: Cool.

210
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.750
John Mertic: So we actually have a quorum of people here.

211
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.460
12486306135: So we can do a vote.

212
00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:57.390
John Mertic: Um. Do I hear a motion to renew feel on for another 12 months in incubation.

213
00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:58.530
So,

214
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.980
Phil Tully: Do I hear a

215
00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:02.430
Second,

216
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:05.730
Second,

217
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.170
John Mertic: All in fate. Well, actually.

218
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:16.170
John Mertic: I would probably would want Peter van del to be making that second

219
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.570
pfandel: Y'all I'll suck at it. Okay.

220
00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:21.540
John Mertic: So going to make sure we get that right there.

221
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.140
John Mertic: For the voting members. All in favor eyes.

222
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:27.300
pfandel: I

223
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:31.440
John Mertic: Was

224
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.310
Enyu Wang: Just joking there button for I

225
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:37.470
John Mertic: Raise

226
00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.290
pfandel: Raise hand I raised my hand for is

227
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.460
That

228
00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.400
pfandel: They can be counted in the chat.

229
00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:45.180
Enyu Wang: In the

230
00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.330
pfandel: Participants window. I like that.

231
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:52.410
John Mertic: Oh man, I learned something new about zoom every day. Excellent. Um,

232
00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:55.530
John Mertic: Is there also a thumbs down. For now, or is it just a

233
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:56.190
Race and

234
00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:00.480
John Mertic: Is there any lower your hand when you're done.

235
00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.250
Phil Tully: Okay, gotcha. Any a poser.

236
00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:02.730
Abstain.

237
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.180
John Mertic: Alright, Fei long you got

238
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:06.780
John Mertic: You got

239
00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.210
John Mertic: You got another lease on life, but I think they're probably

240
00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.820
John Mertic: Within the next probably six months, they probably are.

241
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.060
pfandel: Gonna

242
00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:13.260
John Mertic: Graduate anyways that's

243
00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:13.500
Good.

244
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:29.460
John Mertic: All right, thank you all for that. That was an easy one. Next is Polly's separately, and I know I'm Gerry couldn't make the call today.

245
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:33.480
John Mertic: They kicked back off their TLC calls this week.

246
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:41.430
John Mertic: I think they're working a little bit. Also on the infrastructure buggers qualities also working on some license.

247
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.680
John Mertic: Pieces as well. So there's some license code licenses that need to get cleaned up.

248
00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.800
John Mertic: Before you can start moving over. So I think that's where their main focus

249
00:24:49.800 --> 00:25:01.110
John Mertic: Is on but there was a handful of people on the TLC call. So I think that project is starting to get a little bit of life underneath it, which is good. They meet every other Monday at

250
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:04.590
John Mertic: Least 2PM Eastern

251
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.420
John Mertic: So if you're interested in that project. The next meeting.

252
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:13.170
John Mertic: Of that project is the 20th

253
00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:23.940
John Mertic: At 2PM Eastern and it's on the open mainframe project calendar which, I hope, if you all are subscribed to. I'll drop the

254
00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.640
John Mertic: List. Here you can

255
00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.790
John Mertic: If you go to this URL that I have up on the screen here. I'll put it in the chat.

256
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.100
John Mertic: You can get a calendar view of every

257
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:48.150
John Mertic: event going on with own P subject to the list that you're subscribed to. And then you can subscribe to your calendar, you can add it to your calendar is an eye Cal thing so you can be alerted and keep up to date with that.

258
00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:57.270
John Mertic: And fail on by the way they're 8:30am on Thursdays every other Thursday their next one is the 23rd.

259
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.630
John Mertic: Anything I missed for people from the Polish definitely call it earlier this week, or any questions there.

260
00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:13.470
Phil Tully: I think just like the last one. This is actively

261
00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.110
Phil Tully: Communicating project.

262
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.750
Phil Tully: So I think we should be able to vote on this one as well.

263
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.010
Phil Tully: Well, they

264
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.560
John Mertic: They still have a few months to till they come up for a vote.

265
00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.250
Phil Tully: I thought they were a double now.

266
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:29.520
John Mertic: The next one terse decompresses is the next one there.

267
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:38.250
John Mertic: Um, and so, I'll bring their dev analytics up here by the way if you all, if you want to follow at home with this.

268
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:53.400
John Mertic: You can go, I put a link in there as well. Um, so you can check that out. So terse decompress came out at the end of 2018 there is some commits early on, of just getting the code in there. And then it's just kind of sat dormant.

269
00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:01.260
John Mertic: I've tried to reach out to clause, a little bit to to see if he could join the calls and he's been pretty non

270
00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:01.920
Communicative

271
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:03.750
John Mertic: I don't know.

272
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:06.510
John Mertic: Ingo. Do you have any more context on on this one here.

273
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.710
Ingo Adlung: Which one, which one I said sorry i was i checked just fooling

274
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.130
John Mertic: No worries. No worries. A terse decompress

275
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.550
Ingo Adlung: No. No, I did not. Okay.

276
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:28.740
Phil Tully: Um, yeah.

277
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:38.700
John Mertic: Was has been kind of a kind of a little Mia on me here, as we've been trying to see what we do with this or what I remember when this came in there was sort of this context of

278
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:45.690
John Mertic: You know, do we use this as sort of a way to assemble to gather all sorts of sort of similar tools together.

279
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.920
Or in a project.

280
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.140
John Mertic: I don't know if you're mad if anybody else remembers that conversation.

281
00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.500
Ingo Adlung: Yeah, yeah, I remember that we have been talking about whether

282
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.190
Ingo Adlung: Or not.

283
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:03.780
Ingo Adlung: Well, I think, to recall

284
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:15.510
Ingo Adlung: That we that we had a brief discussion whether whether we should have something like, like, like we formally had was the end tools or so. And that just being the first of a kind, and

285
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.200
12486306135: Which actually

286
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:20.640
12486306135: Which actually would be

287
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:29.550
Ingo Adlung: Would be fine if it would be, it would be assuming that certain things are just done. So we don't we don't need to formally emulate them.

288
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:43.740
Ingo Adlung: But they would be typically part of that tool. Second, but it certainly requires or certainly, certainly also require some some owner or maintainer of that tools crew.

289
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:45.240
John Mertic: Yeah.

290
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.700
John Mertic: Yeah.

291
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.700
pfandel: It's like a useful a useful tool to have

292
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.630
pfandel: But if it has no owner. We need to find one.

293
00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.860
John Mertic: Very good point, yeah.

294
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.740
John Mertic: Yeah.

295
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.450
Ingo Adlung: Klaus Klaus

296
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.240
John Mertic: Klaus Elgar

297
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.570
Ingo Adlung: Oh, close the regular okay I can take that too.

298
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.590
John Mertic: Okay.

299
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.050
John Mertic: All right, thank you and go,

300
00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:22.320
John Mertic: Yeah. And if there's if there's interest in kind of like maybe yet just getting this project into that form. I think it sounds like

301
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.570
John Mertic: There could be some good value and you're right i mean

302
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:30.270
John Mertic: It would be good to just to have these sort of independent and maintain it. It doesn't mean there needs to be commits coming in every day or

303
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:32.670
John Mertic: Every week, or whatever, but

304
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:41.070
John Mertic: You know, just to know that these are kind of all overseen by somebody, there's some sort of a semblance of somebody paying attention to them. I think that's

305
00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:48.510
John Mertic: I think that's probably and I guess I don't want to take the word to the tack. But I think that the from the tax perspective is that mostly what you're looking at here.

306
00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.290
John Mertic: I'm assuming silence means yes

307
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:02.700
Yes.

308
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:04.170
John Mertic: Yeah.

309
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:05.910
pfandel: Okay means yes

310
00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.610
John Mertic: Silence means yes I can take that. Cool. Alright.

311
00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.810
John Mertic: Well, thank you so much for that. Let's move ahead.

312
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:19.170
John Mertic: To Zorro. Do we haven't. I don't think we have anybody from the zero project on

313
00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:20.250
John Mertic: The call do we

314
00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:28.530
John Mertic: Know, um, I don't think I have too many updates bizarre. They've been a little bit

315
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.330
John Mertic: Quiet lately. As we've seen,

316
00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:39.360
John Mertic: From the commits here. I think they're looking to get their TLC meetings back up and going here over the next couple of weeks so

317
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:45.690
John Mertic: I think their next one is scheduled the 30th.

318
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.150
John Mertic: Yeah, the 30th.

319
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.280
John Mertic: At 2PM Eastern

320
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.130
John Mertic: Any questions on the project.

321
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.210
12486306135: Okay, okay.

322
00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:10.620
John Mertic: Um, let's go to active stage at and we have I think we have James caffery on the line today.

323
00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:26.280
JamesCaffrey: You do. Um, again, we are we are getting, you know, regular on regular usage in terms of clones, not what I'd like. But, you know, continuing usage at

324
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:42.060
JamesCaffrey: At a fairly standard record standard usage probably eight to 10 a month, which is what we've seen since its existence and people coming to see it at about 100 to 200 people a month.

325
00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:51.690
JamesCaffrey: And the next thing I wanted to kind of share with people is we've gotten an intern to come help

326
00:31:52.830 --> 00:32:01.770
JamesCaffrey: Work on this and I'm one of the things that I would like him to do is is to work on on

327
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:07.950
JamesCaffrey: Extending the anomaly detection from just the Linux.

328
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:26.070
JamesCaffrey: Sis logs to something a little higher up in the stack and I'm going to talk to them about things like Hadoop or Spark or or any of the law, any of the other pieces of open source software that generate, you know, massive amounts of

329
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.660
JamesCaffrey: Huge blogs that are that are very difficult to go through

330
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.340
JamesCaffrey: So,

331
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:49.380
Ingo Adlung: This, this is this a single I'm wondering about your perspective, whether whether we're that when if we could apply some interim sign it. But if this would be something that that that could also be valuable in a in a cloud context where which is automated where

332
00:32:50.760 --> 00:33:11.130
Ingo Adlung: Were some anomaly detection in such an automated cloud context cookie evaluable so not just a little access the operating system, but the infrastructure itself and whatever. It consists of at least hypervisor but possibly in the switch storage controller weather.

333
00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.750
JamesCaffrey: Yeah, all of those are all those are absolutely correct.

334
00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:21.810
JamesCaffrey: I want to start with something that I can point in in turn to work on.

335
00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:31.740
JamesCaffrey: You know, something that they can get enough data to work on and I may come back to the to the attack and ask for ask for help on that and

336
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:44.400
JamesCaffrey: If my intern is unable to do that. And just to demonstrate that we can to get together started with a baby step of doing one and then if there are others that people think are of interest.

337
00:33:45.480 --> 00:34:04.650
JamesCaffrey: To extend the extend the anomaly detection, where we have analytics or we have sufficient data to do the analytics on it to move those out from from, you know, to move to to add add additional partners and hopefully you know tested analytics against it.

338
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:08.610
JamesCaffrey: The I completely agree with you and go,

339
00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.330
JamesCaffrey: So hopefully we'll see some on

340
00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:23.100
JamesCaffrey: Will see some hopefully he'll be interested in doing that and hopefully we'll be able to make some progress.

341
00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:29.670
John Mertic: Excellent, excellent. And I think he reached out to me for some logs and I think we're going to try to hook them up with some engine X logs.

342
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.380
JamesCaffrey: And engine X logs are are wonderful.

343
00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.190
John Mertic: Yes.

344
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:45.600
John Mertic: They're not beautiful ones. They're mostly our it's actually from our internal DevOps or internal release engineering team. There's, like, well, it's it's logs that are mostly automated clients is that ok and I'm like, well,

345
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:48.630
John Mertic: That's easy way to yeah that's actually really good one.

346
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.140
JamesCaffrey: That's that's the preferred one so

347
00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:57.990
JamesCaffrey: We're going to look at extending we're going to step, we're going to look at to extending the

348
00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:06.030
JamesCaffrey: To whatever whatever we can find logs for and people that are willing to help us work on the logs will start this you know

349
00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:23.790
JamesCaffrey: This summer with with with with an intern working on that. And then we'll move on to, if this works out. We'll move it on to other as we get more we this will go as a model that we can we can deploy insurance on going forward.

350
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.850
John Mertic: That's fantastic. That's fantastic. Let me know if you

351
00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:39.630
John Mertic: If you would be wanting to be a position to sort of communicate that more broadly, like we could do a blog post or something about, you know, the state of AD and kind of the drive towards supporting more back ends and seeing if maybe we can claim reps and community support that way.

352
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:50.430
JamesCaffrey: Oh yeah, if, if he's able to, if, if I think he's able to do it and and i think he's he's willing to do it. Yeah, I will absolutely reach out to you john

353
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:53.400
John Mertic: Perfect, perfect. Great, great, great, great.

354
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:59.370
JamesCaffrey: I, I don't want to commit him to doing something that is going to get him in over his head. That's all I'll say

355
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.920
John Mertic: Now that's that's a very fair way to look at it.

356
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:13.800
John Mertic: Excellent. And I guess in terms, I think we've discussed that with a little bit of the project activity. Were there any questions, sort of, from the tack on to this project came up from an activity standpoint. But is that

357
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:19.500
John Mertic: Is this been helpful for the tack to sort of understand where this is add and the comfortability with it.

358
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.510
Yeah.

359
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:29.160
pfandel: Excellent.

360
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.350
John Mertic: Alright.

361
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:39.600
John Mertic: Well, moving right along here. Next up is the mentorship program Bob couldn't join the call today.

362
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:48.540
John Mertic: But kind of where things so stat. We did announce the call for mentees right before the holidays.

363
00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:57.360
John Mertic: We've had a lot of I think a lot of you who signed up TV mentors have probably got a lot of chatter from students over the last couple weeks. I know.

364
00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.070
John Mertic: I've got some which is

365
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:01.560
John Mertic: Potentially a good sign.

366
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:12.900
John Mertic: I was going to take a look here in the background to see how many submissions. We've got in. I didn't. I hadn't looked as of yet.

367
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:32.460
John Mertic: Now, as you recall, this year, it's a little bit different. Yes, we've had. We've already had one submission already come in for 2020 for the for this year's program. So that's a positive sign we tend to get a lot, towards the end. So I don't really worry about anything very

368
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.030
John Mertic: Early on,

369
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.470
John Mertic: I know, like I said, Bob's two big focuses which are different than this year one.

370
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:51.180
John Mertic: Is that we are being more strict on defining the projects. So we actually have a drop down and pick one of these projects. We can still add more to it. So if any of you have a project idea that you'd want to mentor student on

371
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:57.390
John Mertic: By all means, submit it and we can get it added to that drop down very quickly.

372
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:04.770
John Mertic: And then second is, we're not on a hard schedule this year we're actually having a little bit more of a

373
00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:06.120
John Mertic: flexible schedule.

374
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.370
John Mertic: We kind of bring up

375
00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.290
John Mertic: Up here to see you all in concert

376
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:14.400
John Mertic: To see what I mean.

377
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:19.770
John Mertic: So as you remember in years past, we had a

378
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.110
John Mertic: Us schedule.

379
00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:31.440
John Mertic: And then a you schedule and with the challenger running into students were having trouble picking between both of especially as we started getting a very big influx of Southeast Asian

380
00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:38.940
John Mertic: students participating. So this year. What we ended up changing it to be here.

381
00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.070
pfandel: Is that mentor ships can

382
00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:46.470
John Mertic: Begin anytime after May 1 they have to be started by July 1

383
00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:48.600
John Mertic: And they all have to be completed.

384
00:38:49.050 --> 00:39:01.470
John Mertic: With final evaluation forms in by September 31 so within their. However, it makes sense for scheduling and things like that for students to do it. It all that they can they can do that.

385
00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:16.830
John Mertic: You know, they could schedule. Their eight weeks within their and the stipends will still work exactly the same, you know, $500 at the start, when the project plan is submitted 2500 on the completed midterm and 3000 when they're done, and have a successful final evaluation.

386
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:31.590
John Mertic: So hopefully this adds a little bit more flexibility because I think that was a big challenge we're running to as students last year. Um, but yeah, we're kicked off, we're promoting and so definitely within your channel share and if you

387
00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:36.720
John Mertic: Have other ideas for projects that we have still students looking at them. So feel free to submit

388
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:49.230
JP: John. This is JP, I'm Sean and I have been with so many projects and we've been paying directly by candidate. What is the proper thing to tell you, where do we write redirect them to

389
00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:56.640
John Mertic: I guess in Zen contacting you, what is what tends to be the question that they were asking you.

390
00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:06.900
JP: What they say they're interested they want to learn more about the project and I want to make sure they apply. I want to make sure they go from a process and don't you know kind of miss a deadline.

391
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.330
John Mertic: Yeah. So what I would do.

392
00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:14.340
John Mertic: I mean, I'm, what I'm, what I'm presenting probably is, is they're looking at

393
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.440
John Mertic: One of the

394
00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:18.780
John Mertic: Projects here.

395
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.800
Sean Grady: Yeah, I mean what they've

396
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:38.580
Sean Grady: What I've seen is that they will find the page and GitHub and then find a mentor and contact them directly. So I want to make sure that they are you know registering properly so you can keep track of them.

397
00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:45.120
John Mertic: Yes, yes, because if they don't apply. Then it's a problem. Um, so what

398
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.380
John Mertic: What they can do here.

399
00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:54.240
John Mertic: So basically I would work with them just to make sure that they're comfortable with the

400
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.190
John Mertic: Process and all that.

401
00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.690
John Mertic: And then when they're ready.

402
00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.010
To fix that link here.

403
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.760
John Mertic: They can we have a forum on the mentorship program page here.

404
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.790
John Mertic: Where you can apply, they have to do the application.

405
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:13.350
John Mertic: By February 29

406
00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:20.820
John Mertic: And then they fill out the form here, and I'll send a link if it looks like the link is broken, so I have to fix it real quick.

407
00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:26.760
John Mertic: This quick link here for the mentorship program seems to be working. The other one seems to be broken.

408
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:32.550
John Mertic: So yes, I would encourage all of your students to follow up and post in there.

409
00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:34.740
John Mertic: If you

410
00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:39.480
John Mertic: Kind of, I guess, JP get later the program and I think probably we can probably give

411
00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:42.750
John Mertic: All of the mentors access

412
00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.040
pfandel: To the list of people who

413
00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.300
John Mertic: Are applying so that way you can

414
00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.520
John Mertic: See who's, who's applied.

415
00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:54.570
John Mertic: And then if you see your student hadn't applied yet you can maybe kind of touch up with them and say, hey, I talked to you about this.

416
00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.880
John Mertic: You know, we're able to apply or not or things like that does that.

417
00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:02.130
John Mertic: Does that help answer your question, JP

418
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:04.800
Phil Tully: Yes, he does. I was perfect. Thank you.

419
00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:09.150
JP: Could you give us more details about the selection process. Are we supposed to be involved in that.

420
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:15.750
John Mertic: Yes, so the mentees are actually lead the selection process or the mentors lead the selection process.

421
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.180
pfandel: What we've done in years.

422
00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:26.880
John Mertic: Past, which is worked out good is, you know, Bob kind of does a password list and sort of divvy up the names by projects applied for and then sort of flips them.

423
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:29.010
John Mertic: To the various meant

424
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:34.230
John Mertic: The mentors to go through. Look at the resumes and kind of help rank the candidates.

425
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:37.500
pfandel: And from a one to 10 you know thing, you know, just kind of

426
00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.520
John Mertic: stack rank them.

427
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:46.020
John Mertic: And then from there, with the group as a whole, comes back together. We try to make sure that we can get in

428
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.490
John Mertic: At least one

429
00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:55.230
John Mertic: mentee for each of the projects as much as possible. But then we also recognize some projects get a ton of applications. Some last and so we

430
00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:58.500
pfandel: Try to balance that as best we could. So, but

431
00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:00.270
John Mertic: I guess, to answer your question.

432
00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:06.240
John Mertic: The mentors really drive at least the rankings of it. And then, as a group, we come together and just figure

433
00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:06.780
John Mertic: Out. Okay.

434
00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:08.310
pfandel: Which ones to be able to find which ones.

435
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:11.100
pfandel: That okay

436
00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:13.020
JP: Yes, sir.

437
00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:13.680
Cool.

438
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.600
John Mertic: It's questions. Any other questions at the mentorship program.

439
00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:28.980
John Mertic: Alright, and next on the list is only quick update

440
00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:33.930
John Mertic: From anybody on and we have a couple of zillions here, so maybe they can provide insight.

441
00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:35.850
pfandel: Well Amazonian

442
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.350
John Mertic: Well is the newsletter. Right.

443
00:43:42.030 --> 00:44:00.540
pfandel: Rocket has delivered all of the one.at work. And so we're waiting for IBM and the installers to put that release out and we're hard at work on our Q1 projects. So in JSON Web Tokens out of band MFA node 12 support and a few others.

444
00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.170
Sean Grady: And

445
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:18.510
Sean Grady: I don't know if other groups have other feedback, but I know that in the onboarding squad, they are taking a look at

446
00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:29.550
Sean Grady: Making revisions to the conformance program now that we enter 2020, you know, what have we learned from last year that we would want to put into a new one.

447
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:47.970
Sean Grady: And we are continuing to make progress as Peter said the the items on all of the groups and Zoe shortlist is to get ourselves in shape for a long term support release.

448
00:44:49.470 --> 00:45:03.570
Sean Grady: And I think we're on track with with our previous statements in that regard. And that we want to do something in the first quarter and continue to make the mission throughout the year.

449
00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:23.340
pfandel: And it as a product manager, because that's, that's my role within rocket is product manager for Zoe an open source at rocket my primary goal with respect to Zoe is to drive adoption and so having the LTS are having a support offering commercial support offering

450
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:29.640
pfandel: And tuning the roadmap will all be towards the name of

451
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.640
pfandel: greatly increasing adoption.

452
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.660
John Mertic: Rates. Great. Any other questions and his team.

453
00:45:50.940 --> 00:46:01.230
John Mertic: All right, thank you all for that. So let's go to the last two items on the agenda licensing. This was brought up by Rick Ross Rick, do you want to be that

454
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.850
John Mertic: Rick, you're on mute. If you're around

455
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:14.640
16149350844: Yeah, it was actually. So I'd rather project.

456
00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:20.640
16149350844: On a year ago and we wrapped it up the VM link project.

457
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:27.960
16149350844: And I remember Mark post was asking about getting a place in standard GPS, because I don't think that

458
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.760
16149350844: Rochelle or either one worried about that.

459
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.710
16149350844: So,

460
00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:44.250
16149350844: Any thoughts on licensing. What, what are people looking for and what about going back and revisiting a project and just changing the license.

461
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:49.200
16149350844: I have some ideas. But I was curious if anybody else had suggestions.

462
00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:55.290
John Mertic: So just, just to clarify, is there already a license for VM link or not.

463
00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:07.050
16149350844: I don't think we put a license on that. But at all for some of my projects. My personal Roger step handwritten license, which may itself needs attention, but that's a different question. The question here was,

464
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:16.140
16149350844: VM links kind of a handy tool. I think the distributors out of habit. But Mark said that Souza could not pick it up, unless they had GPS or something compatible.

465
00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:18.780
16149350844: So I'd like to fix that.

466
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.460
Phil Tully: Okay, um,

467
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.970
16149350844: I know my perception.

468
00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.900
John Mertic: Yeah, I mean, you could if you want to. I mean, just to do it. I mean, since if

469
00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:33.840
John Mertic: You would want to do it, sort of, in accordance with

470
00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:39.060
John Mertic: You know, whoever whoever else has contributed and just say, hey, we want to set the license to this.

471
00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.570
12486306135: Right. I've already talked to rush all about it.

472
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:44.490
16149350844: Okay, yeah. So as long as you do that, you

473
00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:45.630
John Mertic: Can put whatever you want on it.

474
00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.870
16149350844: Any reason why third party couldn't do a pull request.

475
00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:52.560
John Mertic: There should

476
00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:53.130
Be

477
00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.170
Phil Tully: Somebody. Go ahead.

478
00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:00.450
16149350844: So those marks.

479
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:03.630
12486306135: I don't understand the question.

480
00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:14.580
16149350844: Well, in this particular case you could I get you to do a pull request and make it look the way you want. Maybe just dropping in JPL into the

481
00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.700
Phil Tully: Into the thing. Would that be enough.

482
00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:19.770
16149350844: Well,

483
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:26.280
12486306135: I can understand why you want it to be a third party just you.

484
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:28.230
12486306135: Well, Rochelle.

485
00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:39.540
16149350844: Rochelle has gone on to do other things. And as far as me. I'm not sure how it should look. Should we just dropped epl in there.

486
00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:46.560
John Mertic: Are you just not sure, just like is JPL. The right license or something else compatible with. Is that also a question.

487
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:59.010
16149350844: Well, I think, in this particular case the GPO would be sufficient for for the distributors to use it. That was the whole purpose was I wanted to see that they could just ship it you know it's anonymous back

488
00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:04.410
12486306135: I will say, since there is currently no license at all.

489
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.970
12486306135: Simply adding a license file.

490
00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:15.090
12486306135: And then the commit message that you met you write when you put that in there. Just saying.

491
00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:25.050
12486306135: The project has decided that we're going to create a license filed so that other people can use this and here it is.

492
00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:29.490
12486306135: It does not have to be GPA, all of that.

493
00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:40.080
12486306135: From a distributor perspective be preferable, but any OSI compliant license should be fine, but

494
00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:48.750
12486306135: I really wanted to leave it up to you, since you're the author. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

495
00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:51.510
16149350844: About some sort of a sacrifice and license. Yeah.

496
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:56.460
12486306135: We cannot distributed because at this point. That's it would be considered a proprietary

497
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:58.350
12486306135: Copy.

498
00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:00.180
12486306135: Write a

499
00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:05.040
12486306135: piece of software that we can't copy. Yeah.

500
00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:06.750
John Mertic: Yeah, I think that 70

501
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:10.770
16149350844: Preference. Yeah, I think that's probably suffering for one. Oh, go ahead.

502
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.510
John Mertic: I'm sorry, keep talking over you. Go ahead.

503
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:15.360
16149350844: What does de Souza, have any preference for one, two or three

504
00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:21.120
16149350844: Mark

505
00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:32.370
16149350844: This is to have a presence for GPs to or GPS one or GPS three

506
00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:41.940
16149350844: Working on a muted.

507
00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:57.240
John Mertic: I put up on the screen just if you're looking at just, you know, possible ways just to help kind of get some of the licensing and contribution guidelines here. This is what we sort of recommend for all of our hosted projects.

508
00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:01.710
John Mertic: Me if this might be helpful for you, just in terms of

509
00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:04.050
12486306135: Compliance, you know,

510
00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:22.980
12486306135: I wasn't here again you know any oversight compliant license will do. I don't think we can say there's any preference within Souza, for which one says GPO of whatever the easiest products.

511
00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:28.950
12486306135: But, you know, we really definitely want to leave that up to the authors.

512
00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:32.130
What they think is best

513
00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:41.490
16149350844: Yeah, it was such an easy project that we just didn't get into it. Okay, thanks a lot. That helps me appreciate it. Thanks for the time. Okay.

514
00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.750
John Mertic: Cool. Um,

515
00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:50.820
John Mertic: And the last item, the agenda was sort of a thing. An update and you, you had around the Travis CI.

516
00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.290
John Mertic: Support for z.

517
00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.750
Enyu Wang: Yes, I just posted the link

518
00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:03.420
Enyu Wang: Around the TRAvels, TRAvels CI announcement for supporting lead

519
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.540
Phil Tully: So in case you don't know

520
00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:26.790
Enyu Wang: You haven't heard about Travis CI, it's a popular build service, especially among open source developers on for doing open source projects on GitHub, because it provides free open free build service for open source projects and has tight integration with GitHub.

521
00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:34.350
Enyu Wang: So, and I think around mid November Travis, the company.

522
00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:49.890
Enyu Wang: Behind Travis CI made an announcement that GitHub universe that now they support the Z architecture along others architectures, for example, Intel in the arm and power.

523
00:52:52.590 --> 00:53:01.680
Phil Tully: For any open source projects, who are interested in testing their code on the Z architecture and built binary sounds the architecture.

524
00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:06.090
Enyu Wang: Because now they can just use the build service without paying a fee.

525
00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:10.110
Enyu Wang: And they don't have to get access to actual the hallway.

526
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:20.280
Enyu Wang: So I think right now. I think so. Last November, it's an alpha stage it's it's soon going to GA and

527
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:28.920
Enyu Wang: Travis also has planned to to GA. They're on prem build tool on the sometime this year.

528
00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:33.780
Enyu Wang: So I will come anybody who's interested to give it a try if

529
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:43.410
Joe Devlin: I missed it detail. They're saying that, where will the code actually get compiled, or is this only

530
00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:50.880
Joe Devlin: Are their cross compilers running on other platforms to do that compiles what what's

531
00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:53.790
Enyu Wang: Yeah, the code after that gets compiled on

532
00:53:54.210 --> 00:54:04.950
Enyu Wang: On the Z or Z architect is not a cross compile so Travis CI is that is a build service running on public clouds IBM provided

533
00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:12.000
Enyu Wang: The architecture in the form of a cloud like community cloud for them to build

534
00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:19.050
Enyu Wang: Actual code for the Z Z architecture. So it's not across compounds as an app component on the actual

535
00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:32.340
Joe Devlin: By a deal between IBM and GitHub. How did this get. I mean, or maybe I'm the the slow kid. I didn't know that such a thing had been done. It's very useful. Of course, when did. Was there an announcement about IBM

536
00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:34.590
Joe Devlin: During the service.

537
00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:51.420
Enyu Wang: The services part of the travesty is underneath the travel CI build infrastructure. So it's not explicitly announced it's through this travesty I announcement.

538
00:54:54.810 --> 00:55:01.290
Joe Devlin: Oh okay though. That's it. Okay, so that, thank you. That helps give me some legal to get online. Thank you.

539
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:07.410
John Mertic: And then you is this specific to Linux on S3 90 x

540
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:09.240
Enyu Wang: Yes, it's, it's for Linux.

541
00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:09.870
John Mertic: Okay.

542
00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:13.380
Joe Devlin: Oh, this is not for zero is this is only for Linux.

543
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:15.000
Yes.

544
00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:16.560
Joe Devlin: Okay.

545
00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:17.250
Phil Tully: Thank you.

546
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:35.490
John Mertic: This is definitely good news, um, especially for open source projects that are kind of in already using Travis. I don't, I don't think there's ways to tie between Jenkins and Travis for my understanding, it's sort of like you're in one camp or the other.

547
00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:36.180
Yeah.

548
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:38.460
John Mertic: Okay.

549
00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:49.470
Enyu Wang: Yeah, please help spread the word. I'm definitely think one big step in terms of driving open source.

550
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:50.880
Option.

551
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:52.800
John Mertic: Is this something

552
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:59.400
16149350844: It'd be kind of cool to have us in there for at least you know

553
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:04.440
Enyu Wang: Yeah, so, so we'll have to look into that because

554
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:06.810
Enyu Wang: Because the Chelsea I build infrastructure.

555
00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:07.530
Enyu Wang: Is tightly

556
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:09.300
16149350844: Is

557
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.040
Enyu Wang: Closely tied with the

558
00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:15.480
Enyu Wang: The, the canonical Alex de container.

559
00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.920
Enyu Wang: Um, so we'll have to look into.

560
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:21.090
16149350844: You know how to

561
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.670
Enyu Wang: You know, enable a tendency was

562
00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:34.350
16149350844: So I'm also CPVC 64 Ellie And I guess if canonical driving it. The only support that did, did we lose all interest in

563
00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:36.180
16149350844: Big Indian

564
00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:41.010
16149350844: Part of me.

565
00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:50.460
16149350844: Is just curious about the architecture. I'm sure canonical is going with the little Indian mode.

566
00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.080
Phil Tully: With power.

567
00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:56.730
16149350844: And I'm curious if they if anybody has any remaining interest in

568
00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:59.700
16149350844: In big Indian our

569
00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:04.410
Enyu Wang: I'm not sure about power, but canonical supports big Indian

570
00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:05.700
16149350844: Z. So

571
00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:09.450
16149350844: Yeah, I'm not wearing

572
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:11.220
16149350844: Canonical source.

573
00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.320
Enyu Wang: Power, I think power.

574
00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.480
16149350844: Decide to go with metal India.

575
00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:25.020
16149350844: Right right yeah that's that's clear. I just, I guess I just throw out a question to the group. Does anyone have any remaining interest in big

576
00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.220
Maybe not. Okay. No big deal.

577
00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:48.690
16149350844: The CHIP, the CHIP being by modal that's kind of a weird thing in my mind I get processor architectures is something I kind of follow in general, and I'm not aware of too many processors that actually could slip between big Indian and little ad in the way the power chip can

578
00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:52.050
16149350844: Is just a curiosity. Thank you.

579
00:57:56.730 --> 00:58:05.490
John Mertic: Well, cool and you we should talk about um if Travis CI wants to get sort of more involved in the open mainframe project as well because I could, I could see maybe us helping

580
00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:17.040
John Mertic: You know, do some of the the crossovers here. To me, it's a useful resource for some of the open source projects that are already using Travis CI, to be able to build out to Linux and would be great.

581
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:17.370
Joe Devlin: It's all

582
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:21.420
Joe Devlin: Also for Zoe, or any of the real CEOs things that go on.

583
00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:43.440
Joe Devlin: You know that if me Travis is a nice, you know, build infrastructure. But if it is is IBM putting the CEO has on the roadmap or not in this offering or be. I apologize for not knowing the voice of the person who the woman who knew the most about this.

584
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:44.610
John Mertic: I think there was any new

585
00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:53.070
Joe Devlin: Okay yeah and and that it could at least find out whether it's on the roadmap or or not. I mean just curiosity.

586
00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:59.010
Enyu Wang: Right, it's, it's actually not on the roadmap, but we can definitely bring it up.

587
00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:16.320
Enyu Wang: And down to your idea that, you know, we should ask them if they're interested in participating co MP very good idea. We're going to have a first meeting with them next Wednesday. I'll definitely bring it up.

588
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:29.640
John Mertic: Okay, yeah. Keep me posted. Yeah, I think we should we should try to get them involved because there's just a lot of common interest, I think that would also help them help their visibility within the mainframe community more

589
00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:36.030
Enyu Wang: Yeah, they're a small company so they could definitely use some help from IBM

590
00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:37.290
Yep.

591
00:59:39.930 --> 00:59:40.800
John Mertic: Okay, cool.

592
00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:46.530
John Mertic: Um, anything else from the grip today.

593
00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.540
Phil Tully: Well, this was a great kickoff of the year meeting. I'm

594
00:59:54.750 --> 01:00:01.050
John Mertic: Definitely really excited, definitely excited to run a lot of the enthusiasts and we have here um next meeting.

595
01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.920
John Mertic: Is just as scheduled here.

596
01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:07.740
John Mertic: On February the

597
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:21.150
John Mertic: Will do some project updates as always. And if anybody if you have any other ideas of topics or things you'd want to present before this group that you think you know just might be interesting from an open source.

598
01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:35.700
pfandel: On mainframe perspectives. I actually, I was on mute, before I did have one other thing. This is Peter. If you look at the chat box. I just put in a URL. If you click on that URL. You'll I think this group might find that interesting. It's a group that's been doing something in the

599
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:40.710
pfandel: Open Source and mainframe related that that's kind of cool.

600
01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.840
John Mertic: I wonder if we could do you have any contacts with them.

601
01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:47.610
John Mertic: Nope.

602
01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.580
John Mertic: We should get them in, they just

603
01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:55.530
pfandel: They just posted it on our rockets open source on the forum.

604
01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:59.310
John Mertic: Wow, we should get them involved here because that's a

605
01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.390
John Mertic: That's a really cool stuff.

606
01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:03.720
18049181726: time away from my screen. What is this, it

607
01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.530
16149350844: Sounds juicy.

608
01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:07.410
16149350844: It's an

609
01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:10.590
pfandel: ISP interface to get

610
01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:20.610
pfandel: Thought, somebody might like that. Yeah.

611
01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.030
John Mertic: They, they really kept it to 42. I mean, it's

612
01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:34.740
John Mertic: It's pretty it's pretty cool. Yeah, let me see if I can try to make connections with them. Maybe we can see if we get them into a future meeting.

613
01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:47.160
John Mertic: Cool. All right. Well, thank you for sharing that. Thank you all. We'll talk next month.

614
01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:49.530
pfandel: Okay, bye.

615
01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:53.730
Ingo Adlung: Thanks, bye. All right.
